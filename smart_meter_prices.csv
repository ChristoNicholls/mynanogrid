### Description:

The E460 smart prepayment meter solution is designed for open standard prepayment and smart metering communication needs. The portfolio includes advanced, single phase (DIN Rail and BS) and three phase, multi-function, STS keypad based, G3 PLC smart prepayment meter solutions.

The metering solution consists of the E460 smart prepayment meter and the P160 Customer Interface Unit.

The E460 meter’s account can be configured as prepayment or post-payment and the meters can be configured to operate as a stand-alone split prepayment meter solution, or as part of an end-to-end smart prepayment AMI solution, comprising of meters, data concentrators, remote data acquisition and data evaluation systems at a central station; all based on field-proven Landis+Gyr technology.

In addition to G3-PLC communication between the meters and the DC450 Data Concentrator and Head end System, the E460 1ph BS and E460 3ph S2 meter also support an RS485 port and under cover modems for point-to-point communications. This extends the use of the E460 meters in high density urban installations where the Data Concentrator is typically employed, as well as low density urban or rural installations where the under-cover modem is used if the number of meters on the transformer does not yet justify the use of a Data Concentrator.

### P160 Customer Interface Unit (CIU)

The split metering solution consists of two parts, the E460 meter and the P160 customer interface unit. Communication between the meter and the customer interface unit is by means of G3-PLC Power Line Carrier, using existing household wiring; no additional communication wires are required.

The P160 Customer Interface Unit is compact with a user-friendly keypad and display. It may be installed in any convenient location in the consumer’s home where there is an electrical socket outlet. An easily replaceable battery is provided for communicating in the absence of AC mains power e.g., when the meter is out of credit.

Split Metering Functionality

The split metering solution consists of two parts, the E460 meter and the P160 customer interface unit. Communication between the meter and the customer interface unit is by means of G3-PLC Power Line Carrier, using existing household wiring; no additional communication wires are required.  The P160 Customer Interface Unit is compact with a user-friendly keypad and display. It may be installed in any convenient location in the

consumer’s home where there is an electrical

socket outlet. An easily replaceable battery is provided for communicating in the absence of AC mains power e.g. when the meter is out of credit.  The E460 meter contains all critical metering, token decryption, load control and smart meter functionality. It operates independently and is immune to any form of tampering on the Customer Interface Unit.  The E460 1ph DIN-Rail meter is typically installed in a pole-top enclosure or secure street kiosk and its small size enables a smaller street kiosk to be used. When used in conjunction with the DC450 G3-PLC Data Concentrator, the meter is able to operate in an on-line mode.

P160 Customer Interface Unit (CIU)

The P160 CIU is plugged into an existing mains outlet in the household. Under normal conditions when the load switch of the meter is closed and there is power in the house, the Customer Interface Unit operates directly from mains voltage. However in the event that the meter load switch opens (e.g. could be due to prepayment credit expiring), the

Technical Specification Sheet

Customer Interface Unit, which is fitted with a battery, will enter a sleep mode to save battery energy. By pressing and holding the

“

Enter/Power key

”

on the keypad, the customer is able to power up the P160 Customer Interface Unit using the battery and enable a new prepayment credit token to be entered. If there is no power in the household and the customer interface unit is woken up using the battery, the display will flash on and off, showing the user the last known status of the meter, for example prepayment credit expired.  The customer or field technician can additionally view meter parameters by accessing specific register information via the P160 Customer Interface Unit keypad or by scrolling through the available pre-configured registers, by pressing the scroll up and down buttons on the P160 keypad.

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)

The E460 solution

is capable of “upstream”

PLC communication to a Data Concentrator typically installed at a street kiosk, low-voltage distribution transformer or mini sub-

station and “downstream”

PLC communications to the P160 Customer Interface Unit. When the DC450 Data Concentrator and back-end (Head-end system) is in place, the E460 meter forms parts of an end-to-end Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) system and powerful e-metering and prepayment capability is able to be supported. When the E460 is used in conjunction with a Data Concentrator and head-end system and forms part of the AMI infrastructure, it supports extensive and powerful e-metering functionality, such as:



two way communications



real time clock synchronised by the system



post-payment or prepayment modes



standard kWh STS token transfer or smart prepayment with currency TOU STS prepayment token



remote disconnect and reconnect



Events and fraud notifications Using supplier-specific 20-digit STS prepayment tokens which are unique to each meter, the E460 meter modes can be switched between post-payment and prepayment modes.

Powerful smart e-metering functions

The meter is able to be configured both locally via the IEC 62056-21 optical interface using

Landis+Gyr’s

dotMAP meter configuration suite of software, and remotely via the Head-end System when in the on-line mode. Real time clock (RTC) is adjustable locally via the optical interface using the Landis+Gyr dotMAP120 meter management tool or remotely synchronised by the Head-end System if the meter is used in conjunction with a Data Concentrator and system. In the smart meter configuration, the meter supports a comprehensive set of Time of Use (TOU) configuration options including active season tables, weekly tables, daily tables and special days.  This smart mode supports prepayment TOU with STS currency token transfer. Up to 6 Time of Use registers may also be configured.  The meter supports a wide range of configurable energy registers. Twelve total energy registers are available, with a further 24 energy registers which can be configured to store available values.  The meter further supports configurable demand registers with configurable integration periods. Various fraud detection log trigger items may be selected for the fraud log, such as terminal cover sensing, strong DC magnetic field detected, measurement software changed, event log cleared and more. A range of quality of supply features are also supported such as voltage supervision with configurable over and under voltage threshold limits and changeable parameters for long duration power failures and minimum power factor threshold. The E460 also has a comprehensive list of power quality event log trigger sources that can be selected as desired, for example under and over voltage, current without voltage and power factor threshold exceeded. F

eatures supporting the meter’s load switch control

include manual or automatic load switch disconnection and re-connection, remote or local (using dotMAP120 meter tool) meter load switch disconnection or re-connection, disconnect on configured threshold values being exceeded, disconnect when supervision monitor thresholds exceeded and if the disconnector event log has been inadvertently cleared. Additional meter load switch Demand and Current Supervision features include configurable power threshold with settable over and under threshold durations limits. Fuse supervision features include the ability to dis

connect the meter’s load switch at a pre

-set amperage based on a specific control source monitored value with configurable minimum delays settings for over and under thresholds.  The P160 Customer Interface Unit display offers seven arrow icons which are individually configurable to indicate by selectable control sources. There are further options to display the

In addition to G3-PLC communication between the meters and the DC450 Data Concentrator and Head end System, the E460 1ph BS and E460 3ph S2 meter also support an RS485 port and under cover modems for point-to-point communications. This extends the use of the E460 meters in high densityurban installations where the Data Concentrator is typically employed, as well as low density urban or rural installations where the under-cover modem is used if the number of meters on the transformer does not yet justify the use of a Data Concentrator. P160 Customer Interface Unit (CIU) The split metering solution consists of two parts, the E460meter and the P160 customer interface unit. Communication between the meter and the customer interface unit is by means of G3-PLC Power Line Carrier, using existing household wiring; no additional communication wires are required. The P160 Customer Interface Unit is compact with a user-friendly keypad and display. It may be installed in anyconvenient location in the consumer’s home where there is an electrical socket outlet. An easily replaceable battery is provided for communicating in the absence of AC mains power e.g., when the meter is out of credit.
