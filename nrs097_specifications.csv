# NRS 097-2-3:2023

# Introduction

This section of NRS 097 is intended to guide South African distributors in terms of simple rules to be applied when applications for LV connected embedded generators are being assessed. The proposed criteria indicate the conditions under which LV connected generators can be connected to the utility grid without having to perform detailed network studies. Applications that do not meet these criteria will need to follow an alternative process, which may require detailed network studies.

# GRID INTERCONNECTION OF EMBEDDED GENERATION

Part 2: Small- scale embedded generation

# Section 3: Simplified utility connection criteria for low-voltage connected generators

# 1\. Scope

This section of NRS 097-2 covers the requirements for simplified utility connection criteria for lowvoltage connected generators. The requirements differentiate between customers supplied by shared and dedicated LV networks, but explicitly exclude lower income domestic electrification networks i.e. shared LV networks supplying customers with a Living Standard Measure of less than seven.

# 3\. Terms, definitions and abbreviations

For the purposes of this document, the following terms, definitions and abbreviations apply.

# 3.1 Terms and definitions

utility: electricity distribution supply authority (see foreword) responsible for the low-voltage electricity network infrastructure in the area of the installation

notified maximum demand: notified maximum demand is the contracted maximum demand, notified in writing by the customer and accepted by the utility at the point of supply

utility installed capacity: the utility’s apparent power installed capacity, that is the minimum of the notified maximum demand stated on the billing system, breaker size, or transformer size

dedicated network: a section of the utility network that exclusively supplies a single customer/generator

NOTE A dedicated network can be a dedicated LV feeder, or a dedicated MV/LV transformer.

shared network: section of the utility network that supplies more than one customer/generator

hybrid installation: a hybrid installation consists of generation and energy storage, often used as an embedded generator and a backup power source when the main power supply is interrupted

NOTE Since the backup power requirement from energy storage is typically much higher than the power export capacity, two power ratings are defined.

maximum export capacity: the maximum aggregative active power the installation is capable to export towards the network at the point of connection set by either the generator rating (e.g., PV array) or a limit set in the power conversion equipment

nameplate power rating: the aggregated maximum nameplate AC apparent power rating of the power conversion equipment, e.g., inverters, synchronous machines, or asynchronous machines.

maximum charging current: the maximum per phase charging current setting of a system equipped with an energy storage system

# 3.2 Abbreviations

ADMD: after diversity maximum demand

EG: embedded generator

LV: low voltage

MCC: maximum charging current

MEC: maximum export capacity

MV: medium voltage

NMD: notified maximum demand

NPR: nameplate power rating

OLTC: on-load tap changing

RVC: rapid voltage change

SSEG: small-scale embedded generator

UIC: utility installed capacity

# 4\. Requirements

# 4.1 General

NOTE 1 The NRS 097-2 series of specifications specify the minimum technical requirements for LV generators connected to the South African grid, as aligned to the requirements of the grid connection code for renewable power plants connected to the electricity transmission system or the distribution system in South Africa.

NOTE 2 Requirements given in this section of NRS 097-2 should be used to evaluate LV generator grid interconnection applications. LV $( < 1 \\mathsf { k } \\mathsf { V } )$ connected generators that fall within these criteria are proposed to follow a simplified connection process that will not require detailed network studies.

NOTE 3 Simplified criteria rules are subject to the following:

a) An individual Maximum Export Capacity (MEC) limit of $2 5 %$ of UIC will typically support a penetration level (percentage of customers that install a generator) of $30 %$ to $50 %$ , which is considered a reasonable and acceptable compromise between restricting individual MECs versus restricting penetration levels.

b) The network feeder design After Diversity Maximum Demand (ADMD) is unknown.

c) The size of plant (nameplate power rating), type of generation, export or non-export, storage or no storage, location of plant and date of installation of ALL generating plants should be captured and documented by the utility CONTINUALLY.

4.1.1 All LV grid connected generator interconnection equipment should be type-test certified complying with the minimum technical requirements of NRS 097-2-1.

4.1.2 Simplified connection of generators is limited to a Nameplate Power Rating (NPR) of less than 1 MVA.

4.1.3 The MEC of an individual LV customer is dependent on:

a) the type of LV network. This depends on whether the LV network that supplies the customer is shared (supplies other customers) or dedicated (only supplies the customer in question directly from the transformer busbar), and

b) the utility installed capacity (UIC).

4.1.4 Additional requirements linked to the size of the MV/LV transformer and maximum loading of the associated MV feeder are discussed in this section of NRS 097-2.

4.1.5 This edition of NRS 097-2-3 does not explicitly provide guidance on utility protection and fault level implications. Fault level related issues are not anticipated for inverter-based generators as the fault current contribution is typically limited to the converter current rating. Equipment fault current ratings should be checked for synchronous or asynchronous generators greater than $1 3 . 8 \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A }$ .

4.1.6 If the criteria in this specification are not met it does not imply that the proposed generator cannot be connected. Rather, more detailed studies are required to assess if the generator can be connected i.e. a simplified connection process cannot be followed (see annex A).

4.1.7 Utilities may modify the criteria, or add additional criteria, to meet their specific requirements considering their network characteristics.

# 4.2 Shared LV feeders

4.2.1 The individual MEC limit in a shared LV feeder (see figure 1) is limited to $2 5 %$ of the customer’s UIC.

4.2.2 The NPR of the installed power conversion equipment is limited to $100 %$ of the customer’s UIC.

4.2.3 For systems equipped with energy storage systems, the charging current measured on the AC terminals of the power conversion equipment is limited to a value equivalent to $2 5 %$ of the customer’s UIC.

4.2.4 The resulting limits for common supply sizes are summarized in table 1.

4.2.5 When the MEC is higher than $4 . 6 \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A }$ , the supply should be three-phase. On the threephase supply, the power unbalance between phases should not exceed $4 . 6 \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A } .$ . The unbalanced MEC should take into account other contributing factors, such as the load distribution between phases.

4.2.6 If the MEC limit is exceeded, the customer could potentially be connected through a dedicated LV feeder, such that the generator is supplied through a dedicated LV feeder (and the dedicated LV feeder limits apply). Alternatively, the customer can apply for an increased UIC e.g., if a customer with a single-phase 60 A supply wants to install a generator with a MEC greater than $3 . 5 \ \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A }$ , then the customer could apply for an upgraded supply to three-phase ${ \\tt G O A }$ whereby the maximum export capacity increases to 10 kVA.

4.2.7 In addition, the total generation exported to a shared LV feeders should be limited to $2 5 %$ of the MV/LV transformer rating. For example, a 200 kVA MV/LV transformer can supply up to $5 0 ~ \\mathsf { k V A }$ of generation supplied through shared LV feeders connected to that transformer.

# 4.3 Dedicated LV feeders

4.3.1 In a dedicated feeder (see figure 1) the MEC is limited to $7 5 %$ of the customer’s UIC.

4.3.2 The NPR of the installed power conversion equipment is limited to $100 %$ of the customer’s UIC.

4.3.3 For systems equipped with energy storage, the charging current measured on the AC terminals of the power conversion equipment is limited to a value equivalent to $2 5 %$ of the customer’s UIC.

4.3.4 The resulting limits for common supply sizes are summarized in table 2.

| 3 | 1500 | 776 | 999 | 375 |

4.3.5 When the MEC is higher than $4 . 6 ~ \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A }$ , the supply should be three-phase. On the threephase supply, the power unbalance between phases should not exceed $4 . 6 ~ \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A }$ . The unbalanced MEC should take into account other contributing factors, such as the load distribution between phases. Customers with dedicated single-phase supplies, supplied by a dedicated MV/LV transformer (e.g., 16 kVA MV/LV dedicated supplies in rural areas), should be allowed to connect up to $100 %$ of their UIC on the available phases with a MEC limit of $7 5 %$ .

4.3.6 The dedicated feeder cable size is limited such that the voltage rise between the point of supply and transformer busbar is limited to $1 %$ .

4.3.7 If the dedicated LV feeder cable size is the constraint, it could be upgraded.

# 4.4 Additional requirements

4.4.1 The total MEC (i.e. shared LV generation and dedicated LV generation) supplied by a MV/LV transformer should be less than $7 5 %$ of the MV/LV transformer rating, and

4.4.2 The total MEC supplied by a MV feeder should be less than $1 5 %$ of the MV feeder peak load.

4.4.3 In the case of non-compliance to the additional requirements, the generator cannot be connected to the network without further detailed studies.

# 4.5 Simplified connection criteria

A summary of the connection criteria is shown in figure 1, and a flow chart that illustrates the simplified connection technical evaluation criteria is given in figure 2.

# Annex A – Notes on more detailed studies

(informative)

NOTE 1 This annex gives guidelines on additional studies that may be required when customers are connected in situations where criteria other than the simplified connection criteria apply. These guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive, but only to guide planners on additional criteria.

NOTE 2 It may be beneficial to evaluate the quality of supply on the network for a period (a minimum of seven days) before concluding on the suitability of the connection point.

# A.1 Fault level at customer point

Determine the short-circuit level (fault level) at the customer point to the desired accuracy. The fault level determines the potential impact that the generator will have on the network.

# A.2 Fault level at SSEG connection point

Compare the fault level at the SSEG connection point to the test fault level of the SSEG (as given in the test certificate). A basic rule of thumb is that the impact of the connected device would vary inversely proportional to the ratio of the fault level. This will be regarded as an equivalent expected impact on the network.

# A.3 Voltage rise

A.3.1 Calculate the expected voltage rise due to the connection of the SSEG at full capacity and the normal operating power factor. Confirm that the voltage rise due to the SSEG is acceptable.

A.3.2 According to VDE-AR-N 4105, the maximum voltage rise due to all generators connected to an LV network should not exceed $3 %$ .

A.3.3 The acceptable voltage rise due to any single generator should be designed in line with the specific network.

A.3.4 Care should be taken on typical residential feeders that any single-phase generator is connected to a phase that is loaded heavier during expected generation periods.

# A.4 Unbalance

A.4.1 Generators should generally improve any unbalance experienced on a network. The potential contribution should be confirmed.

A.4.2 The equivalent expected contribution to voltage unbalance should be less than that specified by NRS 048-4 (See annex D, Generic emission limits evaluated under stage 1).

A.4.3 Care should be taken on typical residential feeders that any single-phase generator is connected to a phase that is loaded heavier during expected generation periods.

A.4.4 Larger units may have to be apportioned under stage 2 in accordance with NRS 048-4.

# Annex A (continued)

# A.5 Flicker

A.5.1 Although flicker is becoming less of a problem, flicker still needs to be managed;

A.5.2 Any start-up voltage change should be limited to $5 %$ (RVC limit on MV networks for up to four events per day);

A.5.3 The equivalent expected contribution to voltage flicker should be less than that specified by NRS 048-4 (See annex D, Generic emission limits evaluated under stage 1).

A.5.4 Larger units may have to be compared against apportioned under stage 2 in accordance with NRS 048-4.

# A.6 Harmonics

A.6.1 Contribution to harmonic distortion is a major concern for any inverter-based generator, including units with power electronic devices connected for control or other operational reasons.

A.6.2 The equivalent expected contribution to voltage harmonics should be less than that specified by NRS 048-4 (see annex D, Generic emission limits evaluated under stage 1).

A.6.3 The recommended current harmonic emission limits can be calculated according to the apportioning stage 2 procedure in NRS 048-4, or can be compared to A.1 (see VDE-AR-N 4105).

# A.7 Protection equipment

A.7.1 Confirm that the fault level contribution of the SSEG will not exceed the ratings of circuitbreakers installed in the system(i.e. the customer that connects the SSEG, neighbouring customers and upstream circuit-breakers). The fault level contribution can be obtained from the SSEG test certificate.

A.7.2 If the fault level contribution from the SSEG is unavailable, the following should be assumed:

a) in the case of synchronous generators: eight times the rated current;

b) in the case of asynchronous generators: six times the rated current; and c) in the case of inverter-based generators: one time the rated current.

A.7.3 Further protection checks may be necessary, for example recloser settings, protection coordination.

# Annex B – Basic for the calculations

(informative)

# B.1 General

NOTE 1 The proposed criteria in this section of NRS 097-2 have been guided by

a) the approaches used in other countries and utilities, as informed by work within Cigre, and specifically Cigre working group C6.24. The intention is to adopt best practice as already applied in other utilities that have considerable experience with LV connected generators; and

b) the application of specific technical criteria on models that represent typical South African LV networks.

NOTE 2 It is intended that the criteria will be enhanced and revised as more detailed studies are performed in the future and that the industry can learn from the application of these criteria.

B.2 The technical limits that constrain the amount of generation are as follows:

a) thermal ratings of equipment (lines, cables and transformers) may not be exceeded.

b) LV voltage regulation should be within the limits specified in NRS 048-2 (LV voltages at the customer point of supply should be within $\\pm \\nobreakspace 1 0 %$ ).

c) the maximum change in LV voltage (due to voltage drop/rise in the MV/LV transformer and LV feeders) due to embedded generators is limited to $3 %$ .

d) the fault level at the customer point of supply should be greater than 210 A, or the minimum fault level at which the generator is rated.

B.3 The application of the limits above resulted in the following proposed criteria:

a) Voltage rise on LV feeders should be limited to a maximum of $1 %$ . This value is informed by the NRS 048 voltage limits, MV voltage control practices and the MV/LV transformer voltage ratio and tap settings.

b) Voltage rise across the MV/LV transformer should be limited such that the NRS 048-2 voltage limits are not exceeded. The maximum generation connected to a MV/LV transformer is limited to $7 5 %$ of the transformer rating understanding that this may result in overvoltage problems on LV feeders where there is further voltage rise. The $7 5 %$ limit is hence high but in reality the net flow through the transformer into the MV network is expected to be significantly less due to the customer loads. A $7 5 %$ limit will also ensure that the transformer will not be overloaded during periods of maximum generation and minimum loading.

c) The individual customer limit of $7 5 %$ of UIC on dedicated LV feeders is informed by the MV/LV transformer limit of $7 5 %$ . This approach provides customers with equitable access to the available generation capacity as limited by the MV/LV transformer rating. It will also ensure that service cables will not be overloaded under conditions of maximum generation and low loading.

d) The dedicated LV feeder minimum size is based on a maximum voltage rise of $1 %$ .

# Annex B

(continued)

e) The individual customer limit of $2 5 %$ of UIC on shared LV feeders is informed by an analysis of typical LV feeder designs whereby the individual MEC was scaled as a function of the design ADMD and the generation penetration level (percentage of customers that install a generator). The voltage rise and change in voltage were calculated assuming that the installed generation is reasonably balanced (connected to the same phases as the load). Setting the individual customer maximum generation limit requires that the penetration level value be established such that technical limits are complied with. An individual limit of $2 5 %$ of UIC will typically support a penetration level of $30 %$ to $50 %$ , which is considered a reasonable and acceptable compromise between restricting individual MECs versus restricting penetration levels. It shall be noted that a primary limitation is the maximum voltage change of $3 %$ .

f) The total generation connected to a MV feeder is limited to $1 5 %$ of the MV feeder maximum loading. This value is informed by practices in the United States and Europe and is based on the ratio of maximum to minimum feeder loading for typical consumer load profiles. A limit of $1 5 %$ will ensure a low probability of reverse power flow into the MV feeder source, thereby preventing voltage rise in the MV feeder and reducing the possibility of an island for operation of MV switches and protection.

As such, a generation limit of $7 5 %$ is proposed, noting that in some situations the voltage limit will be exceeded, and remedial action will be necessary.

# Introduction

This section of NRS 097-2 aims to be technology neutral and focuses on the interface between the embedded generator and the utility, although it is expected that the specification will mainly apply to photovoltaic grid connected systems interfaced through static power converter technology. Static power converters are also utilized to convert for example, wind power, micro-hydro power, pico hydro power, battery storage energy and fuel cells to grid compatible electricity. Other conversion technologies are considered where the requirements deviate from those of static power converters. These include induction generators (where the primary resource may for example be wind or hydro) and synchronous generators (where the primary resource may for example be wind, micro-hydro or diesel).

If utilities can allow embedded renewable energy generation to feed into their networks, this provides a relatively easy way for private sector companies, institutions, and individuals to invest their own resources in renewable generation, without having to undertake detailed own load and storage requirement analysis. The grid acts as a storage facility. This allows considerable leverage of financial resources into the overall renewable energy generation capacity development process.

Where national or local governments define renewable energy objectives, and decide to financially incentivize these through attractive feed-in-tariffs or renewable energy certificates or similar trading systems, small-scale grid-connected options have become a very important component of the overall renewable electricity market.

In South Africa, utilities are receiving an increasing number of requests from customers to allow small-scale embedded generation. As given in the South African Distribution Network Code, the utility is obliged to provide an offer to connect the embedded generator under the conditions in “Application for Connection”, referred to in 3.2 of the Distribution Network Code. The reader is also referred to the Grid Connection Code Requirements For Renewable Power Plants (RPPS) Connected To The Transmission System (TS) Or The Distribution System (DS) In South Africa.

Licensing / registration requirements shall be in line with the relevant electricity regulation act or applicable NERSA requirements. The onus rests on the customer to ensure that all relevant legislation is adhered to.

A key constraint to the implementation of grid-connected small-scale renewable energy activities in South Africa is the lack of pre-approved, generic standards for utility engineers and system promoters to apply in designing and approving the utility interface. This section of NRS 097-2 and its accompanying parts address this need.

The work on “Grid interconnection of embedded generation: Small-scale embedded generation” is based on the following (three key documents):

a) utility interface (this document);

b) embedded generator requirements, which deal with product type approval, installation requirements and certificate of compliance on the EG customer’s side of the meter (a future document); and

c) simplified utility connection criteria, which deals specifically with the commonly designed unidirectional flow of energy in LV networks, with cumulative impacts of EGs, with substation configuration and metering arrangements (NRS 097-2-3:Edition 1 published in 2014).

In addition, a specification will in the future be developed to provide informative guidelines on the implementation procedures, the application form, the license requirements, the certificate of compliance procedures, the commissioning procedures, where applicable, and documentation requirements for the embedded generator. The document will address legal issues such as agreements and ownership, and also metering and revenues from feed-in tariffs. In the case of the utility, it will provide guidelines for the registration process and the record keeping of embedded generators within utility networks and network spurs.

# NRS 097-2-1:2017

NOTE Edition 1 included a clause on uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). However, apart from UPSs connected so that a possibility exists of feeding back into the grid, UPSs falls outside the scope of this document. The clause has therefore been removed. A UPS that is connected such that the possibility exists of feeding back into the grid, i.e. in parallel to the grid, must comply with all the requirements of this document. This requirement is provided in 4.1.

# GRID INTERCONNECTION OF EMBEDDED GENERATION

Part 2: Small-Scale embedded generation

# Section 1: Utility interface

# 1\. Scope

This section of NRS 097-2 defines standards for the utility interface for the interconnection of smallscale embedded generation systems to a utility network.

This section of NRS 097-2 applies to embedded generators or embedded generator systems of nominal capacity less than 1000 kVA, connected to a single-phase, dual phase, or three-phase lowvoltage networks.

This section of NRS 097-2 aims to provide a practical specification for utilities to facilitate the incorporation of embedded generation on low-voltage networks while ensuring compliance of the utility interface with the requirements documented in this specification. This document does not guarantee that the respective utilities will allow connection of the EG at the customer’s preferred location and current terms and conditions; additional requirements may be set by the utility to ensure safety and quality of supply on the network.

This part of NRS 097 does not look at or specify any requirements for the fuel source and or converters of alternate energy sources, i.e. it does not cover specifications for e.g. the following:

a) b) PV panels or the installation thereof; fuel sources, e.g. fuel cells, biogas; and

c) interfaces (mechanical, electrical or different) between the primary fuel source and the inverter or generator, e.g. batteries, gearbox, clutch etc.

The Grid Connection Code Requirements For Renewable Power Plants (RPPS) Connected To The Transmission System (TS) Or The Distribution System (DS) In South Africa version 2.8 was approved by NERSA and published in July 2014. The Grid Code documents are also dynamic documents that may change as requirements in the industry evolves, i.e. updated documents will become available at times and are published on the NERSA website.

The Grid Code defines the minimum requirements for any renewable power plant (embedded generator system) in order to connect to the grid or network. Wherever conflict exists between this set of documents and the applicable Grid Code(s) in terms of more strict requirements, the applicable Grid Code(s) will take preference.

NOTE 1 The 1000 kVA value will be revisited and reviewed as the industry evolves.

NOTE 2 This document provides a standard set of specifications for small embedded generators. Compliance with this document does not guarantee that a utility will or can allow connection to the utility network.

NOTE 3 The customer is advised to contact the utility to discuss potential further connection requirements.

In South Africa, safety is regulated via regulations such as the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act, calling on amongst others the electrical installation regulations, which invokes other standards such as SANS 10142-1.

Performance aspects are regulated via international standards, industry specifications and licensing conditions, which include relevant parts of the grid code(s).

In this part of NRS 097, 4.1 deals with performance aspects, 4.2 deals with safety aspects and 4.3 deals with metering.

# 4.1 Utility compatibility (Performance aspects)

# 4.1.1 General

4.1.1.1 This clause describes the technical issues and the responsibilities related to interconnecting an embedded generator to a utility network.

4.1.1.2 The quality of power provided by the embedded generator in the case of the on-site a.c. loads and the power delivered to the utility is governed by practices and standards on voltage, flicker, frequency, harmonics and power factor. Deviation from these standards represents out-ofbounds conditions. The embedded generator is required to sense the deviation and might need to disconnect from the utility network.

4.1.1.3 All power quality parameters (voltage, flicker, frequency and harmonics) shall be measured at the POC, unless otherwise specified (see annex A).

The power quality to be supplied to customers and influenced by SSEG shall comply with NRS 048- 2. This implies that the combined voltage disturbances caused by the specific EG and other customers, added to normal background voltage disturbances, may not exceed levels stipulated by NRS 048-2. The maximum emission levels that may be contributed by SSEG are provided in this document (see 4.1.5 to 4.1.10).

The customer can expect power quality at the POC in line with NRS 048-2. As such, the generator may not contribute significant disturbances to the voltage supplied at the POC. Typical contributions for small customer installations (total installation) are provided in Annex D of NRS 048-4.

NOTE 1 The frequency cannot be changed by a SSEG.

NOTE 2 The utility is responsible for the power quality at the POC, however, the EG is responsible to mitigate power quality exceedances should it be shown to cause excessive power quality levels.

4.1.1.4 The embedded generator’s a.c. voltage, current and frequency shall be compatible with the utility at the POC.

4.1.1.5 The embedded generator shall be type approved, unless otherwise agreed upon with the utility (see annex A).

4.1.1.6 The maximum size of the embedded generator is limited by the rating of the supply point on the premises.

NOTE Also see NRS097-2-3.

4.1.1.7 The utility will approve the size of the embedded generator and will decide on the connection point and conditions. In some cases it may be required to create a separate supply point. 4.1.1.8 Embedded generators larger than $1 3 , 8 \\mathsf { k V A }$ shall be of the balanced three-phase type unless only a single-phase network supply is available, in which case NRS 097-2-3 recommendations can be applied based on the NMD.

# NRS 097-2-1:2017

NOTE 1 This value refers to the maximum export potential of the generation device/system.

NOTE 2 In the case of long feeder spurs the maximum desired capacity of the EG might require approval by the utility and might result in the requirement for a three-phase connection for smaller units.

4.1.1.9 A customer with a multiphase connection shall split the embedded generator in a balanced manner over all phases if the EG is larger than 4,6 kVA.

NOTE Balancing phases in a multiphase embedded generator is deemed desirable.

4.1.1.10 Embedded generators or generator systems larger than $1 0 0 \\mathsf { k } \\mathsf { V } \\mathsf { A }$ may have additional requirements, for example, they must be able to receive communication signals for ceasing generation/disconnection from the utility supply, if the utility requires such. Communication facilities shall be provided to utility at no charge for integration with SCADA or other system when required. See Annex G (G.1).

NOTE The RPP Grid Code requires category A3 units to be able to interface with the utility in order to receive stop and start signals.

4.1.1.11 In line with the current Renewable Power Plant Grid Code, embedded generators smaller than 1000 kVA connected to low-voltage form part of Category A generators, with the following subcategories:

a) Category A1: 0 – 13,8 kVA;

This sub-category includes RPPs of Category A with rated power in the range from 0 to $1 3 , 8 \\mathsf { k V A }$ , inclusive of 13,8 kVA. b) Category A2: 13,8 kVA – 100 kVA; and

This sub-category includes RPPs of Category A with rated power in the range greater than 13,8 kVA but less than 100 kVA. c) Category A3: 100 kVA – 1 MVA.

This sub-category includes RPPs of Category A with rated power in the range from 100 kVA but less than 1 MVA.

NOTE 1 These sub-categories must be cross-checked with the Renewable Power Plant Grid Code (or other part of the Grid Code where applicable); where applicable, requirements will apply per sub-category and not per sizes defined here.

NOTE 2 Until a separate Grid Code for non-renewable technologies have been compiled and published, relevant categories from this document will apply to non-renewable SSEG.

4.1.1.12 In accordance with SANS 10142-1, all generators shall be wired permanently.

NOTE 1 Some international companies are distributing so-called “plug-in” generators, where a small PV panel and inverter is connected to the supply circuit via a standard (load) plug. At present such installations are not regarded as safe and in contravention of SANS 10142-1.

NOTE 2 This option will be reviewed when internationally accepted norms are finalised to ensure plugs and plug points are safe when feeding power into the grid as well as additional requirements for such generators or plugs.

4.1.1.13 Any UPS/generating device that operates in parallel with the grid may only connect to the grid when it complies fully with the requirements of this part of NRS 097. This includes UPS configurations with or without EG.

NOTE The requirement is applicable irrespective of the duration of parallel operation.

4.1.1.14 Standby-generators are covered by SANS 10142-1.

4.1.1.15 All generators larger than $1 0 0 \\mathsf { k } \\mathsf { V } \\mathsf { A }$ will be controllable, i.e. be able to control the active output power dependent on network conditions/abnormal conditions. This includes several smaller units that totals more than $1 0 0 \\mathsf { k } \\mathsf { V } \\mathsf { A }$ at a single POC.

4.1.1.16 Maximum DC Voltage may not exceed 1000V. This is the voltage on the DC side of the inverter, for example when no load is taken and maximum source energy is provided, e.g. peak solar radiation occurs on the solar panels.

# 4.1.2 Normal voltage operating range

4.1.2.1 In accordance with IEC 61727, utility-interconnected embedded generators do not normally regulate voltage, they inject current into the utility. Therefore the voltage operating range for embedded generators is designed as protection which responds to abnormal utility network conditions and not as a voltage regulation function.

4.1.2.2 The embedded generator shall synchronise (see 4.1.12) with the utility network before a connection is established. The embedded generator shall not control the voltage, unless agreed to by the utility (see annex A).

4.1.2.3 An embedded generator that operates in parallel with the utility system shall operate within the voltage trip limits defined in 4.2.2.3.2.

# 4.1.3 Reference source impedance and short-circuit levels (fault levels)

4.1.3.1 The impact of the generator on the network voltage and quality of supply levels is directly linked to the (complex) source impedance and short-circuit level. The minimum short-circuit level to which a generator can be connected should be based on the size of the generator as well as the design criteria.

4.1.3.2 For general purposes of testing and design for potential worst case conditions, a minimum network strength of the following may be assumed:

Z\_source $= 1 , 0 5 + \\mathrm { j } 0 , 3 2$ ohm, i.e. ${ \\mathsf { I } } \_ { \\mathsf { S C } } = 2 1 0 \\mathsf { A }$ and $\\mathsf { S } \_ { \\mathsf { S C } } = 1 4 6 \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A }$ (three-phase).

NOTE This does not imply a guarantee that the fault level will be more than this at all times. Fault levels less than this may be sufficient for small loads in certain applications.

4.1.3.3 The maximum network strength will be assumed to be no more than 33 times the rated active power of the generator. The R/X ratio will be assumed between 0,33 to 3.

NOTE 1 In practice, the generators will connect to the network at a wide range of short-circuit ratios. The assumption of a maximum ratio of 33 will allow safe connection of the SSEG in most practical situations.

NOTE 2 The minimum fault level at which the generator may be connected is at the discretion of the manufacturer, provided that the requirements of this specification is met at the specified fault level.

4.1.3.4 The relevant utility will advise whether equipment may be connected at other network characteristics, i.e. for weaker parts of the network.

4.1.3.5 The generator documentation and nameplate shall state the reference impedance (complex impedance) and fault level that was used for design and certification and that it is not intended to connect the generator to a network with a higher network impedance than specified for the certification.

NOTE See Annex C (Network Impedance), for more information.

# 4.1.4 General QOS requirements

4.1.4.1 Embedded generators can expect QOS levels on networks to be in line with NRS 048-2. It is expected that the embedded generator will be able to operate continuously under worst-case conditions.

4.1.4.2 Notwithstanding this, the embedded generator must protect itself from potential excursions beyond NRS 048-2 and ensure fail-safe conditions. Should the embedded generator be unable to

operate according to requirements of this document for such excursions, it shall disconnect and cease generation onto the network.

# 4.1.5 Flicker and voltage changes

4.1.5.1 When connected to a network impedance equal to the reference impedance used during certification, no SSEG may generate flicker levels higher than the following:

a) short-term flicker severity $( \\mathsf { P s t } ) = 0 , 3 5$ ; and b) long-term flicker severity $( \\mathsf { P } \| \\mathsf { t } ) = 0 , 3 0$ .

4.1.5.2 It is anticipated that the utility will plan the connections in line with acceptable flicker limits, i.e. the ratio of the size of the generator to the network strength at the point of connection.

4.1.5.3 According to VDE-AR-N 4105, no generator shall be connected to a system where generation rejection (i.e. tripping of SSEG while generating at full capacity, regardless of reason) will lead to a voltage change of $3 %$ or more at the PCC, thereby minimising the potential to exceed rapid voltage change limits.

NOTE 1 A voltage change of $3 %$ aligns to a ratio of the network fault level to generator size of 33 (ignoring network impedance angle and load power factor).

NOTE 2 Standard connection conditions for customers typically include a maximum flicker contribution in line with annex D of NRS 048-4. Should these flicker levels be exceeded, the customer will be required to put mitigating measures in place as and when required by the utility.

# 4.1.6 Voltage unbalance

4.1.6.1 Under normal circumstances, for single and dual-phase EG, the unbalanced generation may not exceed $4 { , } 6 \\mathsf { k } \\mathsf { V } \\mathsf { A }$ connected between any two or different phases at an installation. Units larger than $4 { , } 6 \\mathsf { k } \\mathsf { V } \\mathsf { A }$ will be split evenly over the available phase connections so that this can be maintained.

NOTE Depending on the network capacity, the utility may impose more stringent conditions.

4.1.6.2 Three-phase generators may not contribute more than $0 , 2 \ %$ voltage unbalance when connected to a network with impedance equal to the reference impedance.

NOTE Standard connection conditions for customers typically include a maximum voltage unbalance contribution in line with NRS 048-4, Annex D. Should a three-phase customer exceed these voltage unbalance levels, the customer will be required to put mitigating measures in place as and when required by the utility.

# 4.1.7 Commutation notches

The relative depth of commutation notches due to line-commutated inverters shall not exceed $5 %$ of nominal voltage at the POC for any operational state.

# 4.1.8 DC injection

4.1.8.1 The average d.c. current injected by the embedded generator shall not exceed $0 { , } 5 %$ of the rated a.c. output current over any 1-minute period, into the utility a.c. interface under any operating condition.

4.1.8.2 According to section 4.2.2.5, the generator(s) must disconnect within 500 ms when the d.c.

current exceeds this value.

# 4.1.9 Normal frequency operating range

An embedded generator that operates in parallel with the utility system shall operate within the frequency trip limits defined in 4.2.2.3.3.

# 4.1.10 Harmonics and waveform distortion

4.1.10.1 Only devices that inject low levels of current and voltage harmonics will be accepted; the higher harmonic levels increase the potential for adverse effects on connected equipment.

4.1.10.2 Acceptable levels of harmonic voltage and current depend upon distribution system characteristics, type of service, connected loads or apparatus, and established utility practice.

4.1.10.3 The embedded generator output shall have low current-distortion levels to ensure that no adverse effects are caused to other equipment connected to the utility system.

4.1.10.4 The harmonic and inter-harmonic current distortion shall comply with the relevant emission limits in accordance with IEC 61727, reproduced in table 1.

4.1.10.5 The harmonic and inter-harmonic distortion applies up to $3 \\mathsf { k H z }$ ${ 5 0 } ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ harmonic).

NOTE The harmonic limits above $2 , 5 \\mathsf { k H z }$ and all inter-harmonic limits refer to limits measured in accordance with IEC 61000-4-7.

# 4.1.11 Power factor

4.1.11.1 Irrespective of the number of phases to which an embedded generator is connected, it shall comply with the power factor requirements in accordance with 4.1.11.2 to 4.1.11.12 on each phase for system normal conditions when the output power exceeds $20 %$ of rated active power:

4.1.11.2 For static power converter embedded generators and synchronous embedded generators of sub-categories A1 and A2, the power factor shall remain above 0,98 as shown in Figure 1. The embedded generator shall operate anywhere in the shaded area of figure 1.

NOTE At the time of publication, this is in contradiction with the RPP Grid Code.

4.1.11.3 For asynchronous embedded generators of sub-categories A1 and A2, which cannot control the power factor over any range, the power factor shall reach the shaded area of figure 1 within ${ \\boldsymbol { 6 0 } } ~ \\mathsf { s }$ . The power factor shall remain above 0,98 as shown in figure 1. The embedded generator shall operate anywhere in the shaded area.

NOTE At the time of publication, this is in contradiction with the RPP Grid Code.

4.1.11.4 For static power converter embedded generators and synchronous embedded generators of sub-category A3, the power factor shall remain above 0,95 as shown in Figure 2. The embedded generator shall operate anywhere in the shaded area of Figure 2.

4.1.11.5 For asynchronous embedded generators of sub-category A3, which cannot control the power factor over any range, the power factor shall reach the shaded area of Figure 2 within $6 0 \\thinspace \\thinspace \\mathsf { s }$ . The power factor shall remain above 0,95 as shown in Figure 2. The embedded generator shall operate anywhere in the shaded area.

Figure 2 — Power factor operating requirements for SSEG categoried A3 (using the loadreference arrows system)

4.1.11.6 Where the EG is capable of controlling the power factor at the POC, the EG should improve the power factor at the POC towards unity.

4.1.11.7 Unless otherwise agreed with the utility, the standard power factor setting shall be unity for the full power output range.

4.1.11.8 The maximum tolerance on the reactive power setting is $5 %$ of the rated active power.

4.1.11.9 For embedded generators of sub-category A3, the power factor shall be settable to operate according to a characteristic curve provided by the utility, if required by the utility, within the range 0,95 leading and 0,95 lagging; An example of a standard characteristic curve is shown in figure 3.

![](https://solar-training.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/images/6faf2eeedca268b7984d6c25dd6f14eb0e029f5d7c6b92d0fb87c4cb738ab174.jpg)

Figure 3 — Example of power factor characteristics curve (under-excited)

4.1.11.10 These limits apply, unless otherwise agreed upon with the utility (see annex A).

4.1.11.11 Equipment for reactive power compensation shall either:

a) be connected or disconnected with the embedded generator, or b) operated via automatic control equipment for disconnection when not required.

4.1.11.12 The requirement for and type of detuning for reactive power compensation devices will be agreed upon by the owner of the generator and utility.

NOTE Detuning is highly recommended for all reactive power compensation devices to prevent (a) potential current overloading of capacitors due to existing voltage harmonics, (b) potential voltage transient amplification at the POC due to upstream switching conditions, and (c) potential resonance with the network impedance that may lead to excessive harmonic amplification.

# 4.1.12 Synchronization

4.1.12.1 All embedded generators shall synchronize with the utility network before the parallel connection is made. This applies to all embedded generators where a voltage exists at the generator terminals before connection with the utility network.

4.1.12.2 Automatic synchronization equipment shall be the only method of synchronization.

4.1.12.3 For a synchronous generator, the limits for the synchronizing parameters for each phase are:

a) b) c) frequency difference: $^ { 0 , 3 \\mathsf { H z } }$ , voltage difference: $5 %$ of nominal voltage per phase, and phase angle difference: $2 0 ^ { \\circ }$ (degrees).

4.1.12.4 Mains excited generators do not need to synchronise when the generator is started as a motor before generation starts.

4.1.12.5 Mains excited generators may require soft-starting when the start-up voltage change is anticipated to be more than $3 %$ .

4.1.12.6 The start-up current for static power converters shall not exceed the full-power rated current of the generator.

4.1.12.7 Also refer to 4.2.4 for re-synchronising conditions.

4.1.12.8 The embedded generator shall synchronize with the utility network only when the voltage and frequency has been stable within the ranges provided in 4.2.2.3 for at least 60 seconds.

NOTE Some utilities may require this to be longer than 60 seconds.

# 4.1.13 Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)

4.1.13.1 Until acceptable EMC limits are available in the form of a published IEC standard (IEC

62578 or similar), the conditions of 4.1.13.2 to 4.1.13.3 shall apply.

NOTE Acceptable EMC limits for conducted emissions of inverters in the range up to $1 5 0 ~ \\mathsf { k H z }$ are currently being debated at IEC. A proposed edition of IEC 62578, which provided significantly relaxed limits for inverters specifically, has been rejected by the wider IEC community.

4.1.13.2 Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) refers to the ability of equipment or a system to function satisfactorily in its electromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to anything in that environment. EMC comprises two components, namely a radiated and conducted component. Significant attention is given to radiated EMC due to the potential impact over larger distances. However, with advances in smart grids and business management systems, the potential impacts from conducted EMI must be considered. The conditions in 4.1.13.3 and 4.1.13.4 apply to unintentional signals.

4.1.13.3 All unintentional conducted emissions from generating equipment shall comply with limits for unintentional emissions in SANS 50065-1 in the frequency band $3 \\mathsf { \ k H z }$ to $1 4 8 , 5 \ \\mathsf { k H z }$ and with SANS 211 (CISPR11) above $1 4 8 , 5 \\mathsf { k H z }$ , using limits for Class B group 1 equipment.

NOTE The start frequency given in SANS 211 is $1 5 0 ~ \\mathsf { k H z }$ ; however, to avoid the existing gap, limits applying at $1 5 0 ~ \\mathsf { k H z }$ will be extrapolated down to $1 4 8 , 5 \\mathsf { k H z }$ .

4.1.13.4 The conducted emission requirement applies to all ports or connections to the utility supply, whether the connection is intended for monitoring, communication, power transfer or any other reason for connecting to the utility supply.

4.1.13.5 In the event of susceptibility to electromagnetic interference, the unit shall be fail-safe, i.e. any deviation from intended performance must comply with all relevant specifications, both in terms of safety (i.e. disconnection) and impact on the network.

4.1.13.6 Notwithstanding this, should any interference be experienced to existing or new ripplecontrol, building management system equipment and/or other PLC-based communication, the owner of the embedded generator should take the necessary remedial action to prevent further interference as will be agreed with the utility or the other affected party.

4.1.13.7 All radiated emissions from generating equipment shall comply with SANS 211 (CISPR11), using limits for Class B group 1 equipment.

# 4.1.14 Mains signalling (e.g. PLC and ripple control)

4.1.14.1 Mains signalling refers to intentional signals induced into the utility supply network, where the intention is to facilitate data transfer from one component to another.

4.1.14.2 All intentional emissions (communication signals) from generating equipment shall comply with limits for intentional emissions in SANS 50065-1, limited to an acceptable band as prescribed by SANS 50065-1.

4.1.14.3 Notwithstanding this, should any interference be experienced to existing or new ripplecontrol, building management system equipment and/or other PLC-based communication, the owner of the embedded generator shall take the necessary remedial action to prevent further interference as will be agreed with the utility or the other affected party.

# 4.2 Safety protection and control

# 4.2.1 General

The safe operation of the embedded generator in conjunction with the utility network shall be ensured at all times. Safe operation includes people and equipment safety, i.e.:

a) People safety: and i) owner (including personnel and / or inhabitants of the property) of the embedded generator; ii) general public safety; iii) utility personnel; and iv) general emergency response personnel, e.g. fire brigade should a fire arise at the embedded generator.

b) Equipment safety: i) utility equipment; ii) other customers’ equipment connected to the same network(s); and iii) generator own equipment.

Some of the safety aspects mentioned above may be covered in other specifications and standards and the embedded generator should ensure that safe operation is maintained at all times taking cognisance of all of the above aspects.

Furthermore, the embedded generator owner is responsible for precautions against damage to its own equipment due to utility originating events, e.g. switching events, voltage and frequency variations, automatic reclosing onto the network etc. However, this protection may not conflict with the requirements of this specification.

# 4.2.2 Safety disconnect from utility network

# 4.2.2.1 General

4.2.2.1.1 All SSEG shall comply with the safety requirements in accordance with SANS/IEC 62109-

1 and IEC 62109-2.

NOTE In principle, IEC 62109 documents only apply to PV inverters. However, other SSEG shall prove compliance to these safety requirements to the satisfaction of the utility.

4.2.2.1.2 The embedded generator shall automatically and safely disconnect from the grid in the event of an abnormal condition. Abnormal conditions include:

a) b) c) network voltage or frequency out-of-bounds conditions, loss-of-grid conditions, d.c. current injection threshold exceeded (per phase), d) and residual d.c. current (phase and neutral currents summated).

# 4.2.2.2 Disconnection device (previously disconnection switching unit)

4.2.2.2.1 The embedded generator shall be equipped with a disconnection device, which separates the embedded generator from the grid due to abnormal conditions. The disconnection unit may be integrated into one of the components of the embedded generator (for example the PV utilityinterconnected inverter) or may be an independent device installed between the embedded generator and the utility interface.

4.2.2.2.2 The disconnection switching unit shall be able to operate under all operating conditions of the utility network.

NOTE It is the responsibility of the embedded generator owner to enquire about the operating conditions of the utility network, e.g. fault levels for the foreseeable future.

4.2.2.2.3 A failure within the disconnection device shall lead to disconnection of the generator from the utility supply and indication of the failure condition.

4.2.2.2.4 A single failure within the disconnection switching unit shall not lead to failure to disconnect. Failures with one common cause shall be taken into account and addressed through adequate redundancy.

4.2.2.2.5 The disconnection device shall disconnect the generator from the network by means of two series connected robust automated load disconnect switches.

4.2.2.2.6 Both switches shall be electromechanical switches.

4.2.2.2.7 Each electromechanical switch shall disconnect the embedded generator on the neutral and the live wire(s).

NOTE The switching unit need not disconnect its sensing circuits.

4.2.2.2.8 All rotating generating units, e.g. synchronous or asynchronous generating units shall have adequate redundancy in accordance with 4.2.2.2.5.

4.2.2.2.9 A static power converter without simple separation shall make use of two seriesconnected electromechanical disconnection switches.

4.2.4.2.10 The current breaking capacity of each disconnecting switch shall be appropriately sized for the application. In cases where the disconnecting device is an electromechanical switching device such as a contactor, this requires suitable coordination with the upstream short circuit protection device (circuit breaker).

4.2.2.2.11 Any programmable parameters of the disconnection switching unit shall be protected from interference by third-parties, i.e. password protected or access physically sealed.

4.2.2.2.12 In order to allow customers to supply their own load in isolated operation (islanded) where this is feasible and required, the disconnection device may be incorporated upstream of part of or all of a customers’ loads, provided that none of the network disconnection requirements in this document are violated.

4.2.2.2.13 All EG installations larger than 30 kVA shall have a central disconnection device.

NOTE 1 This requirement may be amended by the utility, i.e. the utility may require a central disconnection switch unit for any size and type of generator.

NOTE 2 This requirement may be amended by the utility. The central disconnection switch unit will typically be waived only when a lockable disconnection switch, accessible to the utility, is installed.

NOTE 3 This is an interim requirement based on requirements of VDE AR 4105 and will be revisited as more information becomes available.

4.2.2.2.14 The network and system grid protection voltage and frequency relay for the central disconnection device will be type-tested and certified on its own (stand-alone tested). All clauses of 4.2.2, except 4.2.2.4 (anti-islanding) apply.

# 4.2.2.3.1 General

The values in 4.2.2.3 relate to SSEG in sub-categories A1 and A2. These are kept from a historical perspective. The Grid Code requirements will override values and requirements in this category.

Sub-category A3 generators shall disconnect from the network according to the RPP Grid Code for all abnormal conditions as well as stay connected in accordance with the voltage ride-through requirements of the RPP Grid Code.

Abnormal conditions can arise on the utility system and requires a response from the connected embedded generator. This response is to ensure the safety of utility maintenance personnel and the general public, and also to avoid damage to connected equipment. The abnormal utility conditions of concern are voltage and frequency excursions above or below the values stated in this clause and the RPP Grid Code (section 5.2 of version 2.8). The embedded generator shall disconnect in accordance with the requirements of 4.2.2.3 if these conditions occur.

The accuracy for voltage trip values shall be within $0 %$ to $+ 1 %$ of the nominal voltage from the upper boundary trip setting, and within $- 1 %$ to $0 %$ of the nominal voltage from the lower boundary trip setting.

The accuracy for frequency trip values shall be within 0 to $+ 0 , 1 \ %$ of the fundamental frequency from the upper boundary trip setting, and within $- 0 , 1 \ %$ to $0 %$ of the fundamental frequency from the lower boundary the trip setting.

# 4.2.2.3.2 Overvoltage and undervoltage

The embedded generator in sub-category A1 and A2 shall cease to energize the utility distribution system should the network voltage deviate outside the conditions specified in table 2. The following conditions shall be met, with voltages in r.m.s. and measured at the POC.

NOTE 1 All discussions regarding system voltage refer to the nominal voltage.

NOTE 2 At the time of publication, these settings are in contradiction to the RPP Grid Code. These may only be applied with exemption to the relevant clause or after the RPP Grid Code has been suitably amended.

NOTE 3 Measurements at the generator terminals will generally be sufficient for the overvoltage settings. If the expected voltage drop across the cable connecting the EG to the POC is too high, undervoltage settings might have to be adjusted.

The purpose of the allowed time delay is to ride through short-term disturbances to avoid excessive nuisance tripping. The generator does not have to cease to energize if the voltage returns to the normal utility continuous operating condition within the specified trip time.

NOTE Induction/synchronous generators need to be mindful of synchronisation issues and may have to apply faster trip times.

A customer with a multiphase connection shall monitor all phases for out-of-bounds voltage conditions. The EG shall be disconnected if an out-of-bounds voltage condition is detected on any of the phases.

In line with NRS 048-2, it is recommended that A1 and A2 SSEG be able to ride through at least Y and X1 type dips, i.e. not disconnect for these events. The purpose is to avoid excessive nuisance tripping.

Category A3 SSEG shall be able to ride through low and/or high voltage events in accordance with the RPP Grid Code.

The generator shall maintain the pre-dip current during any dip event for which it remains connected.

The ride-through and trip times are shown graphically in figure 4.

# 4.2.2.3.3 Over-frequency and under-frequency

This requirement is in line with the RPP Grid Code (version 2.8) and applies to all EG in category A.

NOTE The RPP Grid Code should be consulted for developments in the requirements for response to overfrequency and under-frequency events.

The embedded generation system shall cease to energize the utility network when the utility frequency deviates outside the specified conditions. Both over- and under-frequency conditions indicate system abnormal conditions and all generators are expected to assist in stabilising the system during such periods.

When the utility frequency is less than $4 7 \ H z$ , the embedded generator shall disconnect from the utility network within $\\scriptstyle 0 , 2 \ s$ .

While the utility frequency is in the range of $4 7 \\mapsto$ and $^ { 5 0 , 5 \\mathsf { H z } }$ , the system shall operate normally. In order to prevent hysteresis switching (on-off toggling) during over-frequency conditions, the output power shall be reduced as follows:

When the utility frequency exceeds $^ { 5 0 , 5 \\mathsf { H z } }$ , the active power available at the time shall be stored as the maximum power value $\\mathsf { P } \_ { \\mathsf { M } }$ ; this value $\\mathsf { P } \_ { \\mathsf { M } }$ shall not be exceeded until the frequency has stabilised below $^ { 5 0 , 5 \\mathsf { H z } }$ for at least 4 seconds.

The EG system shall control the output power as a function of $\\mathsf { P } \_ { \\mathsf { M } }$ at a gradient of $50 %$ per Hertz as illustrated in figure 5. The power generation shall follow the curve shown in figure 5 up and down while the system frequency is in the range $^ { 5 0 , 5 \\mathsf { H z } }$ to $5 2 \\mathsf { H z }$ .

When the utility frequency is more than $5 2 \\mathsf { H z }$ for longer than 4 seconds, the embedded generator shall cease to energise the utility line within $\_ { 0 , 5 \\thinspace 5 }$ .

# 4.2.2.3.3.1 Relaxation for non-controllable generators

Non-controllable generators may disconnect randomly within the frequency range $5 0 . 5 \\mathsf { H z }$ to $5 2 \\mathsf { H z }$ . The disconnect frequency for non-controllable generators will each be set at a random value by the manufacturer, with the option of changing this to a utility provided setting. The random disconnect frequency shall be selected so that all generators from any specific manufacturer will disconnect uniformly over the range with $0 , 1 \\mathsf { H z }$ increments.

When the utility frequency is more than the non-controllable generator over-frequency setpoint for longer than 4 seconds, the non-controllable generator shall cease to energise the utility line within $\_ { 0 , 5 \\thinspace \\thinspace \\thinspace \\thinspace s }$ .

NOTE At the time of publication, this is in contradiction with the RPP Grid Cod

Figure 5 — Power curtailment during over-frequency

# 4.2.2.4 Prevention of islanding

4.2.2.4.1 A utility distribution network can become de-energized for several reasons: for example, a substation breaker that opens due to a fault condition or the distribution network might be switched off for maintenance purposes. Should the load and (embedded) generation within an isolated network be closely matched, then the voltage and frequency limits may not be triggered. If the embedded generator control system only made use of passive voltage and frequency out-of-bounds detection, this would result in an unintentional island that could continue beyond the allowed time limits.

4.2.2.4.2 In order to detect an islanding condition, the embedded generator shall make use of at least one active islanding detection method. An active islanding detection method intentionally varies an output parameter and monitors the response or it attempts to cause an abnormal condition at the utility interface to trigger an out-of-bounds condition. If the utility supply is available, the attempt to vary an output parameter or cause an abnormal condition will fail and no response will be detected. However, if the utility supply network is de-energized, there will be a response to the change which can be detected. This signals an island condition to the embedded generator upon detection of which the embedded generator shall cease to energize the utility network within a specific time period.

4.2.2.4.3 Active island detection shall be used in all cases where the EG interfaces with the utility network.

4.2.2.4.4 An islanding condition shall cause the embedded generator to cease to energize the utility network within $\_ { 2 \\thinspace s }$ , irrespective of connected loads or other embedded generators. The embedded generator employing active islanding detection shall comply with the requirements of IEC 62116 (ed. 1).

NOTE Prevention of islanding measures is only considered on the embedded generator side, i.e. no utility installed anti-islanding measures are considered.

4.2.2.4.5 All rotating generators shall use a minimum of two islanding detection methods (e.g. rateof-change-of-frequency and voltage vector shift detection due to the dead bands (slow detection) of islands in both methods).

NOTE It is possible for a condition to exist, where a mains-excited generator becomes self-excited due to capacitance of the network (either cable capacitance or power factor correction). Under such conditions, the mains-excited generator will not disconnect from an island, hence effective islanding detection is required for all rotating generators.

4.2.2.4.6 Passive methods of islanding detection shall not be the sole method to detect an island condition. When used, passive methods of islanding detection shall be done by three-phase voltage detection and shall be verified by an AC voltage source.

4.2.2.4.7 The embedded generator shall physically disconnect from the utility network in accordance with the requirements in 4.2.2.2.

# 4.2.2.5 DC current injection

The embedded generator shall not inject d.c. current greater than $0 { , } 5 %$ of the rated a.c. output current into the utility interface under any operating condition, measured over a 1-minute interval. The EG shall cease to energize the utility network within $5 0 0 ~ \\mathsf { m s }$ if this threshold is exceeded.

# 4.2.3 Emergency personnel safety

No requirements for emergency personnel safety (e.g. fire brigade) existed at the time of publication.

It is expected that such issues will be dealt with in other documents, e.g. OHS Act, SANS 10142-1.

# 4.2.4 Response to utility recovery

4.2.4.1 The embedded generator shall ensure synchronisation before re-energizing at all times in accordance with 4.1.12.

4.2.4.2 After a voltage or frequency out-of-range condition that has caused the embedded generator to cease energizing the utility network, the generator shall not re-energize the utility network until the utility service voltage and frequency have remained within the specified ranges for a continuous and uninterrupted period of 60 s. The reconnection shall commence as follows:

4.2.4.2.1 Non-controllable generators may connect randomly within the 1 minute to 10 minute period after voltage and frequency recovery (period includes the $6 0 \\thinspace \\thinspace \\mathsf { s }$ to confirm recovery). The delay for non-controllable generators will each be set at a random value by the manufacturer, with the option of changing this to a utility provided setting. The random value shall be selected so that no more than $2 %$ of generators from any specific manufacturer will reconnect within 10s of each other.

4.2.4.2.2 Controllable generators may reconnect immediately after the 60 s delay confirming recovery of the system voltage and frequency at a maximum rate of $10 %$ of rated power per minute, i.e. full power output will only be reached after 10 minutes.

This ramp rate may be modified at the request of the utility or in consultation with the utility.

# 4.2.5 Isolation

4.2.5.1 In line with SANS 10142-1 (as amended), each energy source should have its own, appropriately rated, isolation device.

4.2.5.2 It is expected that isolation requirements will be dealt with in more detail in future in e.g.

SANS 10142-1/3. Such requirements shall supersede 4.2.5.

4.2.5.3 The embedded generator shall provide a means of isolating from the utility interface in order to allow for safe maintenance of the EG. The disconnection device shall be a double pole for a single-phase EG, a three-pole for a three-phase delta-connected EG, and a four-pole for a threephase star-connected EG. The grid supply side shall be wired as the source.

4.2.5.4 The breaking capacity of the isolation circuit-breaker closest to the point of utility connection shall be rated appropriately for the installation point in accordance with SANS 60947-2. This disconnection device does not need to be accessible to the utility.

4.2.5.5 For dedicated supplies, a means shall be provided of isolating from the point of supply in order to allow for safe maintenance of the utility network. The disconnection device shall be a double pole for a single-phase EG, a three-pole for a three-phase delta-connected EG, and a four-pole for a three-phase star-connected EG.

This disconnection device shall be lockable and accessible to the utility.

NOTE 1 A device inside a lockable box is deemed a lockable device.

NOTE 2 This disconnection device may become the new point of control as defined by SANS10142-1.

4.2.5.6 The requirement for the utility accessible disconnection device may only be waived by the utility where the risk to the network is deemed acceptable to the utility. Such permission shall be provided in writing.

NOTE Full verification form to be signed off and accepted by the utility.

# 4.2.6 Earthing

4.2.6.1 The electrical installation shall be earthed in accordance with SANS 10142-1 (as applicable). The earthing requirements for different embedded generation configurations in conjunction with the customer network are described in annex B for the most common earthing systems.

NOTE SANS 10142-1 applies to EG feeding a UPS and no connection to the utility supply (see table B5).

4.2.6.2 Installations with utility-interconnected inverters without simple separation shall make use of earth leakage protection which are able to respond to d.c. fault currents including smooth d.c. fault currents (i.e. without zero crossings) according to IEC 62109-2 unless the inverter can exclude the occurrence of d.c. earth fault currents on any phase, neutral or earth connection through its circuit design1). This function may be internal or external to the inverter.

NOTE IEC 62109-2, Edition 2011, section 4.8.3.5 gives selection criteria for RCD sensitivities.

4.2.6.3 Where an electrical installation includes a PV power supply system without at least simple separation between the AC side and the DC side, an integrated RCD function shall be present to provide fault protection by automatic disconnection of supply shall be type B according to IEC/TR 60755, amendment 2. Where the PV inverter by construction is not able to feed DC fault currents into the electrical installation, an RCD of type B according to IEC/TR 60755 amendment 2 is not required.

NOTE 1 Consideration must also be given to ensure that any d.c. currents do not impair the effectiveness of any other RCD’S installed throughout the a.c. system.

NOTE 2 The earth leakage unit may also fulfil the requirement of the all-pole disconnection device as stated in 4.2.6.

NOTE 3 The function of this RCD is not to provide protection against circulating d.c. currents in the inverter and a.c. supply, i.e. does not override 4.1.8.

# 4.2.7 Short-circuit protection

4.2.7.1 The embedded generator shall have suitably rated short-circuit protection at the connection to the AC mains in accordance with SANS 10142-1 and 3.

4.2.7.2 The short-circuit characteristics for the SSEG shall be supplied to the utility.

# 4.2.8 Maximum short-circuit contribution

Embedded generators have the potential to increase the fault level of the network to which it is connected. In order to limit the fault level changes in low voltage networks and allow coordination of fault levels with the utility, no generator will exceed the following fault level contribution:

a) b) c) for synchronous generators: 8 times the rated current; for asynchronous generators: 6 times the rated current; and for generators with inverters: 1 times the rated current.

NOTE At the time of installation, the short-circuit capacity of all existing equipment should be confirmed and upgraded where necessary. Suitable fault current limiting devices may be required to ensure a safe installation. The potential impact on neighbouring installations should also be considered to ensure that those installations remain safe.

# 4.2.9 Labelling

4.2.9.1 A label on the distribution board of the premises where the embedded generator is connected shown in figure 6, shall state: “WARNING: ON-SITE EMBEDDED GENERATION . DO NOT WORK ON THIS EQUIPMENT UNTIL IT IS ISOLATED FROM BOTH MAINS AND ON-SITE GENERATION SUPPLIES.” or similar warning. Disconnection points for all supplies shall be indicated.

4.2.9.2 The label shall be permanent with lettering of height at least $8 \\mathsf { m m }$

4.2.9.3 The label shall comply to requirements of SABS 1186-1.

# 4.2.10 Robustness requirements

According to 4.2.2.1 all SSEG shall comply with safety requirements in accordance to SANS/IEC 62109-1 and IEC 62109-2.

NOTE This section will be expanded in future revisions.

# 4.3 Metering

# 4.3.1 General

4.3.1.1 All meters utilized by the utility shall be the property of the utility even when the meters are located on the premises of the customer. Meters that are embedded in the customer’s network shall be accessible to the utility on request.

4.3.1.2 Three metering configurations are known in the case of premises where embedded generators are operated, dependent on the tariff structure required or implemented by the supplier. The details are given in 4.3.2 and 4.3.3.

4.3.1.3 The utility will advise what metering is required based on the application and location of the embedded generator.

4.3.1.4 Metering will comply to SANS 474/NRS 057 and SANS 473/NRS 071.

4.3.1.5 Where applicable (manual reading), suitable signage will be attached at the meter, indicating that import and export registers need to be read. See 4.2.9.

# 4.3.2 Single-quadrant meter installation

4.3.2.1 The single-meter arrangement is given in figure 8.

4.3.2.2 The EG feeds into the customer network (L), offsetting the customer’s own consumption. If the customer is a net electricity importer from the utility (U), the cumulative consumption meter reading will increase. If the customer is a net exporter, the cumulative consumption meter reading decreases.

Figure 8 — Single meter installation

NOTE This type of installation requires an electronic meter where differentiated import and export rates apply.

4.3.2.3 As a result of using a single meter, the overall consumption and generation of the customer is not recorded. The net import and export of energy is metered and balanced over the metering period.

4.3.2.4 A net meter records and balances energy in a single register. An alternative to the net meter is a bi-directional meter which records energy import and export in separate registers. The registers need to be balanced off against each other to provide the necessary information to the billing system. Separate register meters may be preferred by utilities for reasons of revenue protection.

# 4.3.3 Multiple meter installation

NOTE The feed-in tariff may be worded differently in policy documents, however, the principle is discussed in this section.

4.3.3.1 Feed-in tariff metering records all the energy generated from the embedded generator and reimburses the EG customer at the set FIT. The consumption of the EG customer is recorded in full and billed in the conventional manner. A customer with embedded generation and consumption therefore requires two meters or a bi-directional active energy meter that records energy flow in both directions.

4.3.3.2 The metering configuration for FIT metering is given in figure 8 and is referred to as “separate metering”. An existing consumption meter, whether prepayment or conventional, can remain in place. The embedded generation meter shall be a bi-directional active energy meter that records energy flow in both directions.

4.3.3.3 This metering configuration records overall consumption (L) and overall generation (EG) which is exported to the utility network (U).

4.3.3.4 The separate metering configuration in figure 9 is the most basic FIT metering configuration.

NOTE The relevant regulations applicable in municipalities may not allow this metering configuration in which case the EG can be connected through the separate embedded generation metering configuration shown in figure 9.

4.3.3.5 In the case where the output of the EG cannot physically be taken to the main distribution board of the customer’s premises, an EG meter may be embedded in the customer’s network. The appropriate metering configuration is given in figure 10.

![](https://solar-training.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/images/3533da932a5767e303b1d3131d2f60c9b8a4d752cf6f0503d4b71ad38569f612.jpg)

4.3.3.6 The overall generation of the EG is recorded in the bi-directional embedded generation meter while the overall consumption is balanced off between the net meter and the EG meter2). The net meter shall be a bi-directional meter.

# 4.3.4 Types of meter

4.3.4.1 Energy meters used in conjunction with embedded generation shall record active energy. The meters shall be bi-directional type meters. The meters can either be of the single or the separate register type.

4.3.4.2 The current specification for pre-payment meters does not cater for embedded generation.

4.3.4.3 In the event that installations with embedded generators are required to record reactive energy in conjunction with active energy, four-quadrant electronic meters shall be utilized.

4.3.4.4 Meters with the capability of metering quality of supply parameters shall activate the monitoring facility on the meter.

NOTE The modalities of the billing and revenue procedures for EG customers will be addressed in the future NRS 097-2-4 specification.

# Annex A – Notes to purchase

(informative)

NOTE The customer is advised to contact the utility to discuss potential further connection requirements.

A.1 The following requirement shall be specified in tender invitations and in each order or contract: a) whether all power quality parameters shall be measured at the POC (see 4.1.1.3).

A.2 The following requirements shall be agreed upon between the customer and the utility: a) whether the EG shall be type approved (see 4.1.1.5);

b) whether the EG may control the voltage (see 4.1.2.2); and

c) the power factor limits (see 4.1.11).

# Annex B – Earthing system

(informative)

NOTE SANS 10142-1 does not apply to embedded generators (i.e. connected in parallel to the utility network). Annex B is provided as minimum requirements for earthing systems until the update of SANS 10142-1.

# B.1 Application of SANS 10142-1

# B.1.1 General

SANS 10142-1 applies to low-voltage wiring, earthing, bonding and safety. The requirements in B.1.2 to B.1.5 relating to earthing and to neutral and earth path connections apply.

# B.1.2 Neutral conductor

The neutral conductor shall not be connected direct to earth or to the earth continuity conductor on the load side of the point of control (see 6.1.6 in SANS 10142-1:2012).

# B.1.3 Customer’s earth terminal

Each installation shall have a consumer’s earth terminal (see 3.18 of SANS 10142-1:2012) at or near the point where the supply cables enter the building or structure. All conductive parts that are to be earthed (see 6.12.3 in SANS 10142-1:2012) shall be connected to the main earthing terminal (see 3.29.4 in SANS 10142-1:2012), which shall be connected to the consumer’s earth terminal. The consumer’s earth terminal shall be earthed by connecting it to the supply earth terminal (see 3.78 in SANS 10142-1:2012) or the protective conductor (see 3.15.8 in SANS 10142-1:2012) and, if installed, the earth electrode. The effectiveness of the supply protective conductor shall be determined in accordance with 8.7.5 in SANS 10142-1:2012 (see 6.11.1 as amended by amendment No. 6 in SANS 10142-1:2012).

# B.1.4 Earthing of combined sources

When an installation that has a common neutral is supplied from a combination of transformers and generators located near one another, the neutral terminal of these shall be connected to a single neutral bar. This neutral bar shall be the only point at which the neutral of the installation is earthed except in the case in 7.12.3.1.3 in SANS 10142-1:2012 (see 6.12.4 as amended by amendment No. 6 in SANS 10142-1:2012).

# B.1.5 Neutral bar earthing

B.1.5.1 Protection in accordance with the requirements in 6.7 in SANS 10142-1:2012 shall be provided for the electrical installation in such a manner as to ensure correct operation of the protection devices, irrespective of the supply or combination of sources of supply. Operation of the protection devices shall not rely upon the connection to the earthing point of the main supply.

B.1.5.2 Where there is no existing earth electrode in the electrical installation, a suitable earth electrode may be installed in accordance with SANS 10199. When installed, the electrode shall be bonded to the consumer’s earth terminal and to the earthing point of the generating set with a conductor of at least half the cross-section of that of the phase conductor, but not less than 6 mm copper, or equivalent. This also applies to a single-phase supply.

NOTE 1 In the case of the TN system of electricity supply, an earth electrode is normally not required in an electrical installation (see 7.12.3.1.1 as amended by amendment No. 6 in SANS 10142-1:2012).

# Annex B

(continued)

NOTE 2 IEC 60364-1 distinguishes three families of earthing arrangement, using the two-letter codes TN, TT, and IT. The first letter indicates the connection between earth and the power-supply equipment (generator or transformer). The second letter indicates the connection between earth and the electrical device being supplied. In the case of TN systems, T indicates a direct connection of a point with earth (Latin: terra) and N indicates direct connection to neutral at the origin of the installation, which is connected to the earth.

B.1.5.3 When an installation is supplied from a combination of transformers and generators located near one another, including alternative supplies, the neutral terminal of these shall be connected to a single earthed neutral bar. This neutral bar shall be the only point at which the neutral of the installation is earthed. Any earth leakage unit shall be positioned to avoid incorrect operation due to the existence of the parallel neutral or earth path (see 7.12.3.1.2 as amended by amendment No. 6 in SANS 10142-1:2012).

B.1.5.4 Where alternative supplies are installed remotely from the installation and it is not possible to make use of a single neutral bar, which is earthed, the neutral of each unit shall be earthed at the unit and these points shall be bonded to the consumer’s earth terminal (see 6.12.4 of SANS 10142- 1:2012). The supply that supplies the installation or part of the installation shall be switched by means of a switch that breaks all live conductors operating substantially together (see annex S of SANS 10142-1:2012), to disconnect the earthed neutral point from the installation neutral when the alternative supply is not connected (see also 6.1.6 of SANS 10142-1:2012 and 7.12.3.1.3 (as amended by amendment No. 6 in SANS 10142-1:2012)).

B.1.5.5 Where only part of an installation is switched to the alternative supply in the same distribution board, the neutral bar shall be split (see figure S.2 in annex S of SANS 10142-1:2012) and 7.12.3.1.3 (as amended by amendment No. 6 in SANS 10142-1: 2009).

# B.2 Embedded generator and UPS configurations

B.2.1 Various configurations of embedded generator and UPS systems were examined, and crossreferenced with the main electrical supply earthing configurations (i.e. TN-S, TN-C-S). Table B.1 shows the permutations explored.

NOTE The TT configuration is generally not used in South Africa, but could sometimes be found in certain rural electrification network spurs.

B.2.2 Tables B.2 to B.5 illustrate the typical system application types and connections.

Annex B (continued)

# B.3 Rules of thumb established for embedded generation and alternative systems

# B.3.1 General

Earthing and wiring guidelines were developed as a result of the above rigorous analysis. See tables B.2 to B.5.

# B.3.2 Earth electrode

B.3.2.1 All alternative systems shall have an own earth electrode connected to the consumer’s earth terminal and shall comply with 7.12.3.1.1 in SANS 10142-1:2012.

B.3.2.2 Embedded generators need not have their own earth electrode in accordance with SANS 10142-1, but an own earth electrode is preferred.

# B.3.3 N-PE bridge on consumer’s earth terminal

B.3.3.1 The TN-C-S system shall be bridged between N and PE on the consumer’s earth terminal in the installation on the supply side of the point of control.

B.3.3.2 TN-S and TT systems shall be un-bridged (as normal practice).

NOTE This is to comply with standard installation requirements for safety.

# B.3.4 N-PE bridge on alternative supply

B.3.4.1 TN-S and TT systems shall be bridged.

B.3.4.2 The TN-C-S may be either bridged or un-bridged. This, however, impacts on change-over switch requirements.

B.3.5 Change-over switch No. 1 (between main supply and alternative supply)

B.3.5.1 In the case of alternative systems WITHOUT an internal N-PE bridge (i.e. where N and PE are isolated), the following is required:

a) for a three-phase system: a three-pole change-over switch with common neutral bar; and b) for a single-phase system: a single-pole change-over switch with common neutral bar.

B.3.5.2 In the case of alternative systems WITH an internal N-PE bridge, the following is required:

a) for a three-phase system: a four-pole change-over switch including neutral, or a three-pole with overlapping neutral; and

b) for a single-phase system: a two-pole change-over switch including neutral, or a single pole with overlapping neutral.

B.3.5.3 Manual change-over switches shall be three position switches, i.e. break-before-make.

Annex B (concluded)

B.3.6 Change-over switch No. 2 (between a.c. coupled embedded generator and alternative supply)

B.3.6.1 In the case of a three-phase system, there shall be a four-pole change-over switch including neutral, or a three-pole with overlapping neutral.

B.3.6.2 In the case of a single-phase system, there shall be a two-pole change-over switch including neutral, or a single pole with overlapping neutral.

# Annex C – Network impedance

(normative)

C.1.1.1 The impact of the generator on the network voltage and quality of supply levels is directly linked to the (complex) source impedance and short-circuit level. No representative information is available on the ranges for these quantities in South Africa; international results are used to inform the typical fault level that may be assumed. The reference impedance proposed in IEC 60725 is $\\boldsymbol { 0 } , 4 + \\mathrm { j } \\boldsymbol { 0 } , 2 5 \\Omega$ , resulting in a fault level of 488 A. However, given the typical long feeder installations in South Africa, it may be assumed that the fault levels would be significantly lower.

C.1.1.2 Values available from other countries as measured in 1980 (PQE02) are provided in table C1.

C.1.1.3 Data recorded by France in 1987, indicates a network impedance for $8 5 %$ of its customers supplied via overhead lines as $1 , 1 2 + \\mathrm { j } 0 , 3 6 \\Omega$ or better.

C.1.1.4 A summary of data from Spain is presented in table C2.

# Annex C

(concluded)

C.1.1.5 Based on engineering judgement by the author using the anticipated landscape, and rural versus urban development, of the available data, Spain, Italy and France would seem to have the most comparative LV network design to South Africa. Whilst the X/R ratio of these impedances varies, the most representative values for overhead networks (majority of networks in South Africa) are:

Spain: $1 , 0 5 + \\mathrm { j } 0 , 3 2 \\Omega 9 5 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ percentile (RSA preferred – see 4.1.3.2)

France: $1 , 1 2 + \\mathrm { j } 0 , 3 6 \\Omega 8 5 ^ { \\mathrm { t n } }$ percentile

Italy: $0 , 5 9 + \\mathrm { j } 0 , 3 2 \\Omega 9 5 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ percentile Possible fault levels on LV networks are shown in Error! Reference source not found., using the $5 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ percentile of MV fault levels and two options for the LV feeder transformer and conductor (125 kVA transformer feeding

$2 5 ~ \\mathsf { m m } ^ { 2 }$ conductor versus $3 1 5 ~ \\mathsf { k V A }$ transformer feeding $4 0 0 \ \\mathsf { m m } ^ { 2 }$ conductor). It is clear that many customers may still experience lower fault levels than this.

C.1.1.6 It is proposed that the $9 5 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ percentile impedance be used as a reference for South Africa until better information is available.

# Annex D – (Annex A of VDE-AR-N 4105) Explanations (normative)

# A.1 “Power generation system” (3.1.8) and “power generation unit” (3.1.9)

Figure A.1 shows the power generation system, the power generation unit and the sum of all power generation systems connected to the same network connection point.

![](https://solar-training.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/images/3db8e056aa99657a81dca7d984f55da1172447b9ba88444c5126d68160e1ed85.jpg)

Figure A.1 — Overview on the concepts of power generation unit and power generation system

# A.2 Permissible voltage change (5.3)

The operation of power generation systems changes the operating voltage of the network. The voltage change at the PCC for the extraction of inductive reactive power can be expressed as follows:

$$
\\Delta u \_ { \\mathsf { a } } = { \\frac { S \_ { \\mathsf { A m a x } } \\cdot \\left( R \_ { \\mathsf { k V } } \\cdot \\cos \\left\| \\varphi \\right\| - X \_ { \\mathsf { k V } } \\cdot \\sin \\left\| \\varphi \\right\| \\right) } { { U } ^ { 2 } } }
$$

As shown by equation (A.1), the voltage change may become negative, if the first term in the numerator becomes smaller than the second one, which is possible when cos $\\varphi$ is sufficiently small, hence, if there is a sufficiently high extraction of inductive reactive power.

# Annex D (continued)

For the extraction of capacitive reactive power:

$$
\\Delta u \_ { \\mathrm { a } } = \\frac { S \_ { \\mathrm { A m a x } } \\cdot \\left( R \_ { \\mathrm { k v } } \\cdot \\cos \\left\| \\varphi \\right\| + X \_ { \\mathrm { k v } } \\cdot \\sin \\left\| \\varphi \\right\| \\right) } { { U ^ { 2 } } }
$$

This equation shows that the extraction of capacitive reactive power adds to the voltage increase which is to be taken into consideration for variable reactive power extraction.

Equations (A.1) and (A.2) are practicable approximations. The voltage changes calculated by means of these equations are slightly larger than the more exact results of a complex load-flow analysis.

# A.3 System reactions (5.4)

# A.3.1 Rapid voltage changes

The factor $k \_ { \\mathrm { i m a x } }$ is referred to as the maximum switching current factor and indicates the ratio of the highest current occurring during the switching operation gives (e.g. a starting current $I \_ { \\mathsf { a } } )$ to the nominal current of the power generation system; for example:

$$
k \_ { \\mathrm { i m a x } } = \\frac { I \_ { \\mathrm { a } } } { I \_ { \\mathsf { n } \\mathsf { G } } }
$$

Results obtained from a calculation using this maximum switching current factor represent an upper estimate and are therefore, as a matter of principle, on the safe side. Values for this factor shall be gathered from the certificate of conformity.

If the maximum switching current factor $k \_ { \\mathrm { i m a x } }$ is not calculated using equation (A.3), then the following reference values may be used:

$\- k \_ { \\mathrm { i m a x } } = 1 , 2$ for synchronous generators with fine synchronisation, inverters;

$\- k \_ { \\mathrm { i m a x } } = 4$ for asynchronous generators, which are connected at $9 5 %$ to $105 %$ of their synchronous rotational speed if no further details are available as to the type of current limitation.

With regard to short-term transient phenomena, the condition mentioned below shall be adhered to for very short voltage changes;

$\- k \_ { \\mathrm { i m a x } } = 8$ for asynchronous generators, which are started from the network by means of motors if $I \_ { \\mathsf { a } }$ is unknown.

Rapid voltage changes can be calculated more accurately than with equation (3) if the feed-in and network angles are taken into consideration:

$$
\\Delta u = k \_ { \\mathrm { i } \\mathrm { m } \\mathrm { a x } } \ \\frac { S \_ { \\mathrm { r } \\mathsf { E } } } { S \_ { \\mathsf { k } \\mathsf { V } } } \\cdot \\cos \\left( \\psi + \\varphi \\right)
$$

# Where:

is the network impedance angle $\\psi = \\arctan \\left( \\frac { X \_ { \\mathsf { k } \\mathsf { V } } } { R \_ { \\mathsf { k } \\mathsf { V } } } \\right)$ $\\varphi$ is the displacement factor of the power generation system

The displacement factor $\\varphi$ shall be positive for under-excited generator operation and negative for over-excited generator operation.

# Annex D

(continued)

Even if asynchronous machines or smaller synchronous generators without fine-step synchronisation are connected to the network with an approximately synchronous rotational speed, there may be very short voltage changes as a result of internal transient phenomena. Such a voltage change is permitted to be two times the otherwise applicable value, i.e. $6 %$ , provided that it is no longer than two full oscillations and that the voltage change following it does not exceed $3 %$ of the voltage measured initially before connection of the asynchronous machine.

Coincidence of switching operations of several generators connected to the same PCC leads to a multiple of the voltage change caused by a single generator and is to be avoided, if the maximum voltage change exceeds $3 %$ in total. One possible way that is suitable in terms of technology is to stagger the individual switching operations. With that, the intervals between two switching operations are determined by the magnitude of the voltage changes caused by them and they shall be at least 10 minutes for the maximum permissible apparent generator power. In case of a nominal generator power of less than half the permitted value, an interval of one minute is sufficient.

# A.3.2 Flicker

According to 5.4.3, flicker is deemed to be sufficiently limited for power generation systems with rated currents of up to 75 A, if the limit values of DIN EN 61000-3-3 (VDE 0838-3) or DIN EN 61000-3-11 (VDE 0838-11) are complied with.

If the limit values of DIN EN 61000-3-3 (VDE 0838-3) are not complied with at the reference impedance $Z \_ { \\mathsf { r e f } }$ , connection may still be permissible, according to DIN EN 61000-3-11 (VDE 0838-11), if the amount of the impedance of the supply network at the connection point shared with the public network is less than the amount of the maximum permissible network impedance $Z \_ { \\mathsf { m a x } }$ determined in accordance with DIN EN 61000-3-11 (VDE 0838-11). In order to perform this comparison, the network impedance shall be determined at the connection point and compared with the value $Z \_ { \\mathsf { m a x } }$ gathered from the device documents. The connection owner provides the network operator with the necessary values from the device documents of the manufacturer.

For power generation systems with several power generation units, $P \_ { \\mathrm { \| t i } }$ shall be calculated separately for each individual power generation unit and, using this value, a resulting value for the flicker interference factor at the PCC shall be obtained using the following equation:

$$
P \_ { \\mathrm { { t r e s } } } = \\sqrt { \\sum \_ { i } P \_ { \\mathrm { { t i } } } ^ { 2 } }
$$

For a power generation system consisting of $n$ identical power generation units, the resulting value for the flicker interference factor is:

$$
\\quad P \_ { \\mathrm { I t r e s } } = { \\sqrt { n } } \\cdot P \_ { \\mathrm { I t E } }
$$

# A.3.3 Harmonics and inter-harmonics

# A.3.3.1 General

When calculating the permissible harmonic currents care shall be taken not to apply the rated shortcircuit power of the low voltage network but the actual network short-circuit power $S \_ { \\mathsf { k V } }$ at the PCC.

For the superposition of the harmonic currents of certain inverter types, the type specific rules listed in the following apply.

# Annex D (continued)

# A.3.3.2 Line-commutated inverters (six- or 12-pulse)

The inverter-typical harmonic currents (of $5 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ order, $7 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ order, $1 1 ^ { \\mathfrak { t h } }$ order, $1 3 ^ { \\mathrm { t h } }$ order, etc.) as well as non-typical ones of very low order $( \\nu < 1 3 )$ are added up arithmetically:

$$
I \_ { \\nu } = \\sum \_ { i = 1 } ^ { n } I \_ { \\nu }
$$

For the non-typical harmonics of higher order $( \\nu \\ge 1 3 )$ , the total harmonic current of an order equals the root of the sum of squares of the harmonic currents of this order:

$$
I \_ { \\nu } = \\sqrt { \\sum \_ { i = 1 } ^ { n } { I \_ { \\nu } } ^ { 2 } }
$$

# A.3.3.3 Pulse-modulated inverters

For an ordinal number $\\mu$ which is, in principle, non-integral but also includes integral values for values of $\\mu \\geq 1 3$ , the total current equals the root of the sum of squares of the currents of the power generation units:

$$
I \_ { \\mu } = \\sqrt { \\sum \_ { i = 1 } ^ { n } { I \_ { \\mu } } \_ { i } ^ { 2 } }
$$

If untypical harmonic currents occur with such inverters for integral ordinal numbers of $\\nu < 1 3$ , these currents shall be added up arithmetically in correspondence to equation (A.7). Harmonic currents above $2 ^ { \\mathsf { n d } }$ order as well as inter-harmonics may be calculated using equation (A.9), if the pulse frequency of the inverter is at least $1 \\mathsf { k H z }$ .

If several power generation units/power generation systems are effective at the same PCC, then the harmonic currents permissible for an individual power generation unit/power generation system are calculated from the apparent power $S \_ { \\mathsf { A i m a x } }$ of the power generation unit/power generation system $i$ and the feed-in power connectable or planned $S \_ { \\mathsf { A V } }$ at this PCC as follows:

for arithmetical addition of the harmonic currents, using equation (A.7):

$$
I \_ { \\nu \\sf A i z u l } = I \_ { \\nu \\sf z u l } \\cdot \\frac { S \_ { \\sf A i m a x } } { S \_ { \\sf A V } }
$$

for square addition of the harmonic currents using equation (A.8) and equation (A.9):

$$
I \_ { \\nu \\sf A i z u l } = I \_ { \\nu \\sf z u l } \\cdot \\sqrt { \\frac { S \_ { \\sf A i m a x } } { S \_ { \\sf A V } } }
$$

Under special circumstances, harmonics of higher frequency (i.e. within a range above $1 2 5 0 \\mathsf { H z } )$ may occur, which are attributable to the fact that weakly damped resonances of sub-networks are excited by commutation notches. In such a case, particular measures shall be taken which are described in greater detail in Technische Regeln zur Beurteilung von Netzrückwirkungen (Technical rules for evaluation of network reactions).

# A.4 Connection criteria (5.5)

Table A.1 shows the possible variants of feed-in and protection as determined by the maximum apparent power of the power generation system $S \_ { \\mathsf { A m a x } }$ .

# A.5 Reactive power (5.7.5)

For power generation units, the reactive power control serves to better integrate the power generation systems into the low-voltage network. It provides an important contribution to the efficient use of available network capacities.

Along with the properties of the power generation system (fluctuating or constant feed-in), it is also required to take into account the respective network conditions in order to achieve optimum usage.

In a network in which the feed-in power is limited by the voltage criterion (typically line taps), the voltage stability can be optimised by under-excited operation of the power generation system (Figure A.2).

![](https://solar-training.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/images/88a6e2a3e0e930119cad1f726fb16e88acafd71fcebf46147e6ec44c26a81c4f.jpg)

Figure A.2 — Potential for optimisation provided by a suitable reactive power feed-in for typical overhead line or cable types (related to an operation mode where cos $\\varphi = 1$ )

# Annex D

(continued)

The bandwidth takes into account an under-excited operation mode between cos $\\varphi = 0 , 9$ and cos $\\varphi = 1$ , typical local network transformers as well as the distance of the power generation system to the local network transformer.

Due to their lower $R / X$ ratio, the potential for optimisation is generally larger for overhead lines than it is for cables. Even for great distances from the local network transformer, there are considerable effects on the mains voltage when using a suitable reactive power control.

However, it shall be noted that the reactive power control comes along with a greater power loss in the low-voltage network. This power loss can be minimised using a characteristic curve cos $\\varphi ( P )$ . When doing so, the power generation system is operated in an under-excited mode only, if it feeds with nearly rated power. Because of this behaviour, the characteristic curve cos $\\varphi \\left( P \\right)$ is suitable for power generation systems with fluctuating power feed-in, such as PV systems.

The network operator may provide different characteristic curves for the power generation system’s reactive power operation mode depending on the network conditions. In general, the prescribed characteristic curve cos $\\varphi \\left( P \\right)$ has two, however, not more than four nodes (cf. Figure A.3).

![](https://solar-training.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/images/90b6632f3226294173057aaafce50a928034ddd6f6503d9a52d088d310e8bdf7.jpg)

![](https://solar-training.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/images/a2d906b820da285c42380ac06dbcbd4c2cfdcb87e3eff09938b1d6a3b6bef4c9.jpg)

Figure A.3 — Examples of a characteristic curve cos $\\sqsupset$ (P) with three nodes

Starting with a power of $0 , 2 P \_ { \\mathsf { E m a x } }$ , the characteristic curve shall be adhered to.

The reactive power operation mode used to ensure static voltage stability in the networks is a new requirement for power generation systems and requires further consideration in particular for reactive energy clearing and for the use of reactive current compensation systems.

For full feed-in of the power generation system, the network operator will, in general, require an the power generation system to operate in an under-excited mode above $\_ { 0 , 5 } P \\mathfrak { n }$ (also see the standard characteristic curve cos $\\varphi \\left( P \\right)$ in Figure 4).

(continued)

For excess feeding the use of an “intelligent” reactive current compensation system is required which, depending on the overall behaviour of the customer system for extraction or feed-in, regulates the displacement factor cos $\\varphi$ respectively required for the entire customer system at the network connection point. As long as the required reactive current compensation systems are not commercially available, it is advisable to use a differentiated approach when specifying the displacement factor cos $\\varphi$ of the power generation system.

In the case of the greater part of the generated power being supplied to the network operator’s network and for a feed-in power of more than approx. one third of the maximum extraction power agreed, a displacement factor cos $\\varphi$ in the range from 0,90under-excited to 0,95under-excited is normally to be set in accordance with the network operator’s provisions. If a reactive current compensation system regulates in relation to cos $\\varphi$ at the network connection point, then the predefined value shall be set at the reactive current compensation system. The power generation system may be set to cos $\\varphi = 1$ . If cos $\\varphi$ is regulated only in correspondence to the extraction customer part of the customer system, then the power generation system shall be set to the value of cos $\\varphi$ provided by the network operator.

More detailed information on the power ratio can be obtained by network calculations examining the effects that the different load cases of the customer system have on the voltage change at the network connection point.

In cases where the feed-in power is less than one third of the maximum extraction power agreed, a specific default for the displacement factor of the power generation system is normally not required. For minimisation of the losses in the entire system, a displacement factor of cos $\\varphi = \\uparrow$ shall be aimed for.

If a reactive energy clearing is applied that is influenced by the power generation system, then the network operator and the system operator should always coordinate their procedures for a reactive power compensation of the customer system and for the default displacement factor for the power generation system. It may also be sensible to use a reactive energy meter (e.g. load- profile meter) for the power generation system and, for balancing purposes, to take into account the entire supply point for the customer system.

# A.6 General requirements, single-fault tolerance (6.1)

The central NS protection, integrated NS protection, integrated interface switch as well as the trigger circuit consisting of the integrated NS protection and integrated interface switch shall meet the requirements for single-fault tolerance.

Taking into account the basic safety principles, these devices shall be designed, constructed, chosen, assembled and combined at least so that they can withstand the operating conditions to be expected (e.g. reliability with regard to their breaking capacity and switching frequency) as well as the external influences to be expected (e.g. mechanical vibration, external fields, interruptions or disturbances of the energy supply).

A single fault shall not lead to a loss of the safety function. Faults of common cause shall be taken into account if the probability for the occurrence of such a fault is significance. Whenever reasonably practical, the individual fault shall be displayed and lead to the power generation unit or system being disconnected.

NOTE 1 This requirement for the detection of individual faults does not mean that all faults are detected. Accumulation of undetected faults can therefore lead to an unintentional output signal and to a hazardous state.

# Annex D (continued)

NOTE 2 This system allows for:

a) b) c) the safety to always be maintained in the event of a single fault; some but not all faults to be detected; the accumulation of undetected faults to possibly lead to the loss of the safety functions.

NOTE 3 Further explanation of the term “single-fault tolerance”: For implementation of the single-fault tolerance, all the units required for the protective functions in the devices are executed so that, in the event of a fault occurring (e.g. malfunctioning of a processor or measurement amplifier), this malfunction is detected by another unit and leads to disconnection.

Independent of each other, the series-connected switches shall have a breaking capacity corresponding to the rated current of the power generation system. At least one switch shall be executed as a power relay or contactor and be suitable for overvoltage category 2. For single-phase feed-in systems, the switch shall have one contact of this overvoltage category each for both the neutral conductor and the line conductor. For poly-phase supply systems, it is required to have one contact of this overvoltage category each for all active conductors. The second switch may be formed by the electronic switching components of the inverter bridge or another circuit provided that the electronic switching components can be disconnected by control signals and that it is ensured that a failure is detected and leads to prevention of the operation at the latest at the next reconnection.

For inverters without simple separation between network and PV generator (inverters without transformers), both the switches mentioned in the paragraph above shall be executed as power relays, contactors or mechanical circuit-breakers with the requirements described therein, although a disconnection device is permitted to be connected between PV generator and inverter.

# A.7 Interface switch (6.4)

All-phase switching means switching all active conductors of the power generation system from the feed-in point to the customer system or from the network operator’s network (depending on the interface switch mounting place). DIN VDE 0100-200 (VDE 0100-200) defines active conductors as all conductors intended to be live under normal operating conditions and includes the neutral conductor. By agreement, PEN conductors are excluded.

DIN VDE 0100-460 (VDE 0100-460) defines the conductors to be switched. Depending on the network system at the interface switch mounting place, the following requirements arise. In the TT system, the three line conductors and the neutral conductor shall be connected. In the TN-C system and in the TN-C part of the TN-C-S system, the three line conductors shall be connected. In the TN-S system and in the TN-S part of the TN-C-S system, the three line conductors and the neutral conductor shall be connected. This means that, with the exception of the conductors with a PE function, all conductors shall be connected.

If connection of the neutral conductor is required, then a interface switch shall be used which connects the neutral conductor with phase-lead at turn-on and phase-lag at turn-off, however, at least simultaneously.

# A.8 Protective devices for the interface switch (6.5)

# A.8.1 General

With regard to the proper protection of the power generation system, it shall be considered that the short-circuit current is considerably lower for island mode than for network parallel operation. For power generation systems feeding into the low-voltage network via inverters, it may even be less than the system’s rated current. The use of residual current devices (RCD) may be inevitable.

Annex D (concluded)

# A.8.2 Protective functions

Should operational problems occur for existing systems in the context of the protective functions required by the now obsolete VDEW directive “Eigenerzeugungsanlagen am Niederspannungsnetz” (Power generation systems connected to the low-voltage network) (such as problems with the net impedance measurement hitherto applied), the existing system may be retrofitted following the provisions of this VDE application guide.

Annex E (continued)

# B.6 Connection with meter column

# Connection point of the low-voltage network ~ 400 V/230 V

# 5.5 Connection criteria

As a rule, power generation systems shall be designed and connected to the network as balanced three-phase generators. Power generation systems may also be single-phase connected to the network, if the sum of all single-phase connected power generation units per network connection does not exceed $S \_ { \\mathsf { E m a x } } \\leq 4 , 6$ kVA per line conductor. Therefore, it is possible to connect in single phase, distributed to the three line conductors, at maximum $3 \\times 4 , 6 ~ \\mathsf { k V A } = \\Sigma S \_ { \\mathsf { E } \\mathsf { m } \\mathsf { a } \\mathsf { x } } \\leq 1 3 , 8 ~ \\mathsf { k V A } .$ As soon as the limits given above are exceeded at the network connection point, any extension shall be three-phase connected to the three-phase system. For all that, the maximum permissible imbalance of $4 , 6 \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A }$ at a single network connection point for the sum of all power generation systems applies here as well. This requirement may also be satisfied by communicatively coupling single-phase connected power generation units of the same primary energy carrier or by replacing the single-phase inverters with three-phase inverters.

5.6.3 Three-phase inverter systems For three-phase power generation systems with network feed-in over inverters, the power shall be fed three-phase balanced into the three line conductors. The inverter circuit shall preferably be set up as a three-phase current unit. A circuit of single-phase inverters is deemed to be technically equivalent, if these inverters feed three-phase balanced into the three line conductors by means of a suitable communicative coupling.

# Annex G – Generation management network security management (normative)

# G.1 Generation management network security management

NOTE While no South African utility currently has the required communication systems in place for LV systems, embedded generators may be NERSA exempt in providing on-line communication interfaces. However, should the utility require this in future, the embedded generator will provide the required interface at their own cost. Section G.1 provides the recommended requirements for such an interface. At the time of publication, basic communication requirements for category A3 generators are provided in the RPP Grid Code.

G.1.1 In addition to requirements elsewhere in this specification, the embedded generator shall be able to control the following parameters as and where signals are sent by the utility:

G.1.1.1 Active power control, typically a temporary reduction in active power output;

G.1.1.2 Reactive power control, i.e. change of the operating power factor or power factor curve of the generator.

G.1.2 For each operational state and/or operational point, the embedded generator must be able to reduce the output power to less than or equal to an active power set-point provided by the utility.

G.1.3 Embedded generation systems with a power output capability of $1 0 0 \\mathsf { k } \\mathsf { V } \\mathsf { A }$ or more shall be able to control the output power in steps of $10 %$ or less of the rated active power.

G.1.4 The embedded generator active power output shall reach the new set-point within a period of 1 minute. If this set-point cannot be reached within 5 minutes, the embedded generator shall disconnect from the system.

NOTE This implies that embedded generators without the capability to control the output power adequately or in adequate steps, shall disconnect from the system when a reduction in active power output is requested.

G.1.5 Embedded generation systems with a power output capability of $1 0 0 \\mathsf { k } \\mathsf { V } \\mathsf { A }$ or more shall be able to control the reactive power (power factor) is steps of $5 %$ or less of the rated power.

G.1.6 Reactive power shall reach the new set-point within a period of 1 minute. If this set-point cannot be reached within 5 minutes, the embedded generator shall disconnect from the system.

G.1.7 According to the RPP Grid Code version 2.8, the accuracy of the control performed for both the active power and reactive power controls, and of the setpoint of both the active power and reactive power, shall not deviate by more than $\\pm 2 %$ of the setpoint value or by $\\pm 0 { , } 5 %$ of the rated power, depending on which yields the highest tolerance.

NOTE Appropriate communication protocols are under discussion with the Grid Code Advisory Committee and will be provided in a future edition of this document. This capability will then become compulsory for all new equipment.

# G.2 Principles for network support

As a rule, power generation systems of subcategory A3 shall be able to contribute to the static voltage stability in the utility network. Static voltage stability is the voltage stability in the low-voltage network at which the slow voltage changes are maintained within compatible limits in the distribution network. If required due to network related circumstances and by the utility, the embedded generator shall contribute to the static voltage stability in the low-voltage network.

Dynamic grid support, i.e. voltage stability in the event of voltage drops in higher voltage levels, is not required for embedded generators connected to low-voltage networks.

Annex G (concluded)

NOTE This requirement applies tor units larger than $1 0 0 ~ \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A }$ only, smaller units on dedicated circuits (i.e.

part of sub-category A3) are exempt.

# G.3 Emergency personnel safety

The safety of emergency personnel, e.g. fire brigade, shall be dealt with elsewhere.

DC installations will be covered by SANS 10142-X (future document).

A utility accessible disconnector will be available to emergency personnel that will disconnect the a.c.

NOTE This clause will be superseded by requirements in the future SANS 10142-X document or other relevant requirements based on the Occupational Health and Safety act (Act No. 85 of 1993) as amended.

G.3.1 Appropriate signage shall be installed. The requirements shall be cross-checked with requirements of SANS 10142-1. An example of signage as required by this section of NRS 097 is provided in 4.2.10.

G.3.2 It is preferable that all SSEG be installed with emergency shutdown equipment. Examples of requirements are listed in G.3.2.1 to G.3.2.4. The manufacturer shall prove that the emergency shutdown processes and procedures are in line with current international best practices.

G.3.2.1 All a.c. voltages should be shut off, regardless of the operating mode of the equipment at the time of shutdown.

G.3.2.2 All fuel inputs to a SSEG (e.g. water feed to a hydro-generator, d.c. input to an inverter, etc.) should be shut off; regardless of the operating mode of the equipment at the time of shutdown.

NOTE PV panels cannot be switched off.

G.3.2.3 Equipment that have emergency shutdown capabilities, shall have a “fireman’s switch” installed in accordance with SANS 10142-1 at the time of installation in order to activate emergency shutdown.

NOTE The d.c. from PV panels and/or battery storage will be assumed to be live.

G.3.3 The absence of emergency shutdown capabilities will be indicated on signage referred to in G.3.1.

# Introduction

This section of NRS 097 is intended to guide South African distributors in terms of simple rules to be applied when applications for LV connected embedded generators are being assessed. The proposed criteria indicate the conditions under which LV connected generators can be connected to the utility grid without having to perform detailed network studies. Applications that do not meet these criteria will need to follow an alternative process, which might require detailed network studies.

# GRID INTERCONNECTION OF EMBEDDED GENERATION

Part 2: Small-scale embedded generation

# Section 3: Simplified utility connection criteria for low-voltage connected generators

# 1 Scope

This section of NRS 097-2 covers the requirements for simplified utility connection criteria for lowvoltage connected generators. The requirements differentiate between customers supplied by shared and dedicated LV networks, but explicitly exclude lower income domestic electrification networks i.e. shared LV networks supplying customers with a Living Standard Measure of less than seven.

# 3 Terms, definitions and abbreviations

For the purposes of this document, following terms, definitions and abbreviations apply.

# 3.1 Terms and definitions

# dedicated network

section of the utility network that exclusively supplies a single customer/generator

NOTE A dedicated network can be a dedicated LV feeder, or a dedicated MV/LV transformer.

# generator size

maximum change in active power flow at the point of utility connection for a generator trip (or rapid reduction in output) when generating at full active power output

NOTE Some or all of the power generated may be consumed by the customers’ local loads. Where there is no local storage the generator size is the active power rating of the installed generation. In cases with local storage, the storage can be used to reduce the effective size of the generator by compensating for variations in generation output, hence the definition used above.

# shared network

section of the utility network that supplies more than one customer/generator

# utility

electricity distribution supply authority (see foreword) responsible for the low-voltage electricity network infrastructure in the area of the installation

# 3.2 Abbreviations

ADMD: after diversity maximum demand

EG: embedded generator

LV: low voltage

MV: medium voltage

NMD: notified maximum demand

OLTC: on-load tap changing

RVC: rapid voltage change

SSEG: small-scale embedded generator

# 4 Requirements

# 4.1 General

NOTE 1 The NRS 097-2 series of specifications specify the minimum technical requirements for LV generators connected to the South African grid, as aligned to the requirements of the grid connection code for renewable power plants connected to the electricity transmission system or the distribution system in South Africa.

NOTE 2 Requirements given in this section of NRS 097-2 should be used to evaluate LV generator grid interconnection applications. LV (230 V/400 V) connected generators that fall within these criteria are proposed to follow a simplified connection process that will not require detailed network studies.

NOTE 3 Simplified criteria rules are subject to the following:

a) An individual limit of $25 %$ of NMD will typically support a penetration level (percentage of customers that install a generator) of $30 %$ to $50 %$ , which is considered a reasonable and acceptable compromise between restricting individual generator sizes versus restricting penetration levels.

b) The network feeder design After Diversity Maximum Demand (ADMD) is unknown. c) The size of plant, type of generation, location of plant and date of installation of ALL generating plants should be captured and documented by the utility CONTINUALLY.

4.1.1 All LV grid connected generator interconnection equipment should be type-test certified complying with the minimum technical requirements of NRS 097-2-1.

4.1.2 Simplified connection of generator sizes should be limited to 350 kVA.

4.1.3 The maximum permissible generation size of an individual LV customer is dependent on:

a) the type of LV network. This depends on whether the LV network that supplies the customer is shared (supplies other customers) or dedicated (only supplies the customer in question), and

b) the customer’s notified maximum demand (NMD). The NMD in many cases is determined by the LV service connection circuit-breaker rating.

4.1.4 Additional requirements linked to the size of the MV/LV transformer and maximum loading of the associated MV feeder are discussed this section of NRS 097-2.

4.1.5 The LV fault level at the customer point of supply should be greater than 210 A.

NOTE Details of the selection of the 210 A fault level is discussed in annex C of NRS 097-2-1:2010.

4.1.6 If the criteria in this standard are not met it does not imply that the proposed generator cannot be connected. Rather, more detailed studies are required to assess if the generator can be connected i.e. a simplified connection process cannot be followed (see annex A).

4.1.7 Utilities may modify the criteria, or add additional criteria, to meet their specific requirements considering their network characteristics.

# 4.2 Shared LV feeders

4.2.1 The maximum individual generation limit in a shared LV feeder (see figure 1) is approximately $25 %$ of the customer’s NMD, up to a maximum of 20 kVA (generators greater than $2 0 ~ \\mathsf { k V A }$ should be connected through a dedicated LV feeder).

![](https://pqrs.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/images/9d3920630b3cef2a39ffeafd687efcdc95d3e9f30ce237a2d656dede638f4769.jpg)

Figure 1 — Shared LV feeder

4.2.2 The resulting maximum generator sizes for common domestic supply sizes are summarized in table 1.

NOTE The values have been adjusted to align with VDE-AR-N 4105 and hence vary slightly from $25 %$ of the NMD. For circuit-breaker sizes not included in table 1, the maximum individual generation limit is $25 %$ of the customer notified maximum demand, i.e. $25 %$ of the circuit-breaker size. The individual limit is only dependent on the service circuit-breaker rating, and not on the feeder After Diversity Maximum Demand (ADMD). Future refinements of these criteria will assess the incorporation of ADMD into the decision framework.

Table 1 — Maximum individual generation limit in a shared LV (400 V/230 V) feeder

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| Number ofphases | Service circuit-breaker size | NMDkVA | Maximum individual generation limitkVA |
| 1 | 20 A | 4,6 | 1,2 |
| 1 | 60 A | 13,8 | 3,68 |
| 1 | 80 A | 18,4 | 4,6 |
| 3 | 60 A and 80 A | 41,4 | 13,8 (4,6 per phase) |

4.2.3 In shared LV feeders, any generator greater than $4 , 6 \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A }$ should be balanced across phases.

4.2.4 In the case of LV customers with supplies greater than those given in table 1, the maximum individual generation limit in a shared LV feeder is $25 %$ of the customer’s NMD. For example, a LV customer with a 100 kVA NMD supplied through a shared LV feeder could connect up to $1 0 0 \\times 2 5 % = 2 5 \\mathrm { k V A }$ of generation. Since $2 5 ~ \\mathsf { k V A }$ is greater than the $2 0 ~ \\mathsf { k V A }$ limit for a shared feeder, the maximum size is $2 0 ~ \\mathsf { k V A }$ and as $2 0 ~ \\mathsf { k V A }$ is greater than the 4,6 kVA single-phase limit, it shall be three-phase connected.

4.2.5 If the maximum individual generation limit is exceeded, the customer could potentially be connected through a dedicated LV feeder, such that the generator is supplied through a dedicated LV feeder (and the dedicated LV feeder limits apply). Alternatively the customer can apply for an increased NMD e.g. if a customer with a single-phase 60 A supply wants to install a generator greater than $3 , 6 8 ~ \\mathsf { k V A }$ , then the customer could apply for an upgraded supply to three-phase ${ \\tt G O A }$ whereby the maximum generator limit increases to 13,8 kVA.

4.2.6 In addition, the total generation supplied by shared LV feeders should be limited to $25 %$ of the MV/LV transformer rating. For example, a 200 kVA MV/LV transformer can supply up to $5 0 \ k \\mathsf { V } \\mathsf { A }$ of generation supplied through shared LV feeders connected to that transformer.

# 4.3 Dedicated LV feeders

4.3.1 In dedicated LV feeders (see figure 2), the maximum individual generation limit is a function of:

a) The notified maximum demand. The maximum generator size is limited to $75 %$ of the NMD. Generators greater than $4 , 6 \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A }$ should be balanced across the available phases. Customers with dedicated single-phase supplies supplied by a dedicated MV/LV transformer (e.g. $1 6 \\mathsf { k V } \\mathsf { A }$ MV/LV dedicated supplies in rural areas) should be allowed to connect up to $1 3 , 8 \\mathsf { k V A }$ on that single-phase but should not exceed $75 %$ of their NMD.

b) The dedicated feeder cable size is limited such that the voltage rise between the point of supply and transformer busbar is limited to $1 %$ . Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the maximum generator size as a function of the dedicated LV feeder cable size and length.

4.3.2 If the dedicated LV feeder cable size is the constraint, it could be upgraded.

4.3.3 Connections that only supply generators will be made through a dedicated LV feeder i.e. if the customer does not have load and only injects power into the network, then the connection should be made through a dedicated feeder with a minimum size in accordance with figures 3 and 4. As the customer is not a conventional load and does not have an NMD, the maximum generator size will be limited by the dedicated LV feeder size (figures 3 and 4) and the maximum MV/LV transformer limit (see additional requirements in 4.4).

# 4.4 Additional requirements

4.4.1 The following requirements apply in addition to the requirements for shared and dedicated LV feeder connected generators:

a) the total generation (i.e. shared LV generation and dedicated LV generation) supplied by a MV/LV transformer should be less than $75 %$ of the MV/LV transformer rating, and

b) the total generation supplied by a MV feeder should be less than $15 %$ of the MV feeder peak load.

4.4.2 In the case of non-compliance with the criteria in 4.4.1(a) and 4.4.1(b), additional generation does not meet the simplified connection criteria. Therefore, it cannot be connected to the network without further detailed studies.

4.4.3 This edition of NRS 097-2-3 does not explicitly provide guidance on utility protection and fault level implications, which will be included in a future revision. Fault level related issues are not anticipated for inverter based generators as the fault current contribution is typically limited to the converter current rating. Equipment fault current ratings should be checked for synchronous or asynchronous generators greater than $1 3 , 8 \\mathsf { k V A }$ .

# 4.5 Simplified connection criteria

A summary of the connection criteria is shown in figure 5, and a flow chart that illustrates the simplified connection technical evaluation criteria is given in figure 6.

a) the approaches used in other countries and utilities, as informed by work within Cigre, and specifically Cigre working group C6.24. The intention is to adopt best practice as already applied in other utilities that have considerable experience with LV connected generators; and

b) the application of specific technical criteria on models that represent typical South African LV networks.

NOTE 2 It is intended that the criteria will be enhanced and revised as more detailed studies are performed in the future and that the industry can learn from the application of these criteria.

4.6.2 The technical limits that constrain the amount of generation are as follows

a) thermal ratings of equipment (lines, cables and transformers) may not be exceeded;

b) LV voltage regulation should be within the limits specified in NRS 048-2 (LV voltages at the customer point of supply should be within $\\pm 1 0 %$ );

c) the maximum change in LV voltage (due to voltage drop/rise in the MV/LV transformer and LV feeders) due to embedded generators is limited to $3 %$ . This is a common international practice where the generation is variable. This will ensure that voltage changes due to short-term variations in generation output are within acceptable limits for example every time there is a cloud transient the LV voltages should not vary by more than $3 %$ (as photo-voltaic output changes). It is important to note that the generation supplies loads that would otherwise be supplied by the utility network. From a voltage change perspective, it does not matter how much of the generation is consumed locally or fed back into the network. When the generation output changes, the loading in the utility network changes accordingly as the utility network supplies loads that would have been supplied by the embedded generator. Hence voltage change magnitudes (due to changes in generation output) are dependent on the generation size, and not on the net export magnitude into the utility network;

d) islanding on the utility network is not allowed;

e) the fault level at the customer point of supply should be greater than 210 A, or the minimum fault level at which the generator is rated.

4.6.3 The application of the limits given in 4.6.2 resulted in the following proposed criteria:

a) Voltage rise on LV feeders should be limited to a maximum of $1 %$ . This value is informed by the NRS 048 voltage limits, MV voltage control practices and the MV/LV transformer voltage ratio and tap settings (see table 4).

b) Voltage rise across the MV/LV transformer should be limited such that the NRS 048-2 voltage limits are not exceeded (see table 5). The maximum generation connected to a MV/LV transformer is limited to $75 %$ of the transformer rating understanding that this may result in overvoltage problems on LV feeders where there is further voltage rise. The $75 %$ limit is hence high but in reality the net flow through the transformer into the MV network is expected to be significantly less due to the customer loads. A $75 %$ limit will also ensure that the transformer will not be overloaded during periods of maximum generation and minimum loading.

c) The individual customer limit of $75 %$ of NMD on dedicated LV feeders is informed by the MV/LV transformer limit of $75 %$ . This approach provides customers with equitable access to the available generation capacity as limited by the MV/LV transformer rating. It will also ensure

that service cables will not be overloaded under conditions of maximum generation and low loading.

d) The dedicated LV feeder minimum size is based on a maximum voltage rise of $1 %$ (figure 3 and figure 4). The $1 %$ value is in accordance with table 4.

e) The individual customer limit of $25 %$ of NMD on shared LV feeders is informed by an analysis of typical LV feeder designs whereby the individual generator size was scaled as a function of the design ADMD and the generation penetration level (percentage of customers that install a generator). The voltage rise and change in voltage were calculated assuming that the installed generation is reasonably balanced (connected to the same phases as the load). Setting the individual customer maximum generation limit requires that the penetration level value be established such that technical limits are complied with. An individual limit of $25 %$ of NMD will typically support a penetration level of $30 %$ to $50 %$ , which is considered a reasonable and acceptable compromise between restricting individual generator sizes versus restricting penetration levels. It shall be noted that a primary limitation is the maximum voltage change of $3 %$ .

f) The total generation connected to a MV feeder is limited to $15 %$ of the MV feeder maximum loading. This value is informed by practices in the United States and Europe, and is based on the ratio of maximum to minimum feeder loading for typical consumer load profiles. A limit of $15 %$ will ensure a low probability of reverse power flow into the MV feeder source, thereby preventing voltage rise in the MV feeder and reducing the possibility of an island for operation of MV switches and protection.

4.6.4 The calculated result is $0 { , } 9 %$ , but given the uncertainty in the input parameters, a value of $1 %$ is proposed. In accordance with table 5, the application of the $1 %$ voltage rise and maximum generation limit of $75 %$ of the MV/LV transformer size may result in cases of voltage levels in excess of NRS 048-2 limits.

4.6.5 At a generation level of $75 %$ of the MV/LV transformer rating, the maximum LV voltage at the MV/LV transformer LV terminals rises to $1 1 0 { , } 1 \ %$ which is at the upper limit of $110 %$ . If the LV voltage is allowed to rise by a further $1 %$ in the LV feeders then the maximum LV voltage is 111, $1 %$ which is above the NRS 048-2 limit. However in reality there will be load that will reduce the effect of the voltage rise. As such, a generation limit of $75 %$ is proposed, noting that in some situations the voltage limit will be exceeded and remedial action will be necessary.

Annex A (informative)

# Notes on more detailed studies

NOTE 1 This annex gives guidelines on additional studies that may be required when customers are connected in situations where criteria other than the simplified connection criteria apply. These guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive, but only to guide planners on additional criteria.

NOTE 2 It may be beneficial to evaluate the quality of supply on the network for a period (a minimum of seven days) before concluding on the suitability of the connection point.

# A.1 Fault level at customer point

Determine the short-circuit level (fault level) at the customer point to the desired accuracy. The fault level determines the potential impact that the generator will have on the network.

# A.2 Fault level at SSEG connection point

Compare the fault level at the SSEG connection point to the test fault level of the SSEG (as given in the test certificate). A basic rule of thumb is that the impact of the connected device would vary inversely proportional to the ratio of the fault level. This will be regarded as an equivalent expected impact on the network.

# A.3 Voltage rise

A.3.1 Calculate the expected voltage rise due to the connection of the SSEG at full capacity and the normal operating power factor. Confirm that the voltage rise due to the SSEG is acceptable.

A.3.2 According to VDE-AR-N 4105, the maximum voltage rise due to all generators connected to an LV network should not exceed $3 %$ .

A.3.3 The acceptable voltage rise due to any single generator should be designed in line with the specific network.

A.3.4 Care should be taken on typical residential feeders that any single-phase generator is connected to a phase that is loaded heavier during expected generation periods.

# A.4 Unbalance

A.4.1 Generators should generally improve any unbalance experienced on a network. The potential contribution should be confirmed.

A.4.2 The equivalent expected contribution to voltage unbalance should be less than that specified by NRS 048-4 ( See annex D, Generic emission limits evaluated under stage 1).

A.4.3 Care should be taken on typical residential feeders that any single-phase generator is connected to a phase that is loaded heavier during expected generation periods.

A.4.4 Larger units may have to be apportioned under stage 2 in accordance with NRS 048-4.

Annex A (continued)

# A.5 Flicker

A.5.1 Although flicker is becoming less of a problem, flicker still needs to be managed;

A.5.2 Any start-up voltage change should be limited to $5 %$ (RVC limit on MV networks for up to four events per day);

A.5.3 The equivalent expected contribution to voltage flicker should be less than that specified by NRS 048-4 ( See annex D, Generic emission limits evaluated under stage 1).

A.5.4 Larger units may have to be compared against apportioned under stage 2 in accordance with NRS 048-4.

# A.6 Harmonics

A.6.1 Contribution to harmonic distortion is a major concern for any inverter-based generator, including units with power electronic devices connected for control or other operational reasons.

A.6.2 The equivalent expected contribution to voltage harmonics should be less than that specified by NRS 048-4 (see annex D, Generic emission limits evaluated under stage 1).

A.6.3 The recommended current harmonic emission limits can be calculated according to the apportioning stage 2 procedure in NRS 048-4, or can be compared to A.1 (see VDE-AR-N 4105).

# A.7 Protection equipment

A.7.1 Confirm that the fault level contribution of the SSEG will not exceed the ratings of circuitbreakers installed in the system(i.e. the customer that connects the SSEG, neighbouring customers and upstream circuit-breakers). The fault level contribution can be obtained from the SSEG test certificate.

A.7.2 If the fault level contribution from the SSEG is unavailable, the following should be assumed:

a) in the case of synchronous generators: eight times the rated current;

b) in the case of asynchronous generators: six times the rated current;

c) in the case of inverter based generators: one time the rated current.

A.7.3 Further protection checks may be necessary, for example recloser settings, protection coordination.

# 1\. Introduction

# 1.1.SSEG installations in municipal distributor areas are accelerating

The acceleration of embedded generator installations, particularly solar photovoltaics (PV), is a trend municipal distributors across the country are having to adjust to. Much of this is small-scale embedded generation (SSEG), which is up to 1 MW in capacity. This trend is expected to continue as solar PV prices decrease and Eskom power prices rise steadily, which corresponds with a global acceleration of such installations. Some distributors are reporting as much as a doubling of numbers of SSEG systems each year. While these developments have many benefits, accelerating SSEG connections can bring a range of challenges to municipal distributors, including technical, financial and staff capacity issues.

# 1.2. Installed capacity of SSEG

The South African Local Government Association (SALGA) recently conducted a survey to estimate total installed SSEG capacity in municipal distributor areas, and whether such distributors have processes in place to assess and accept suitable systems onto their networks. The report, Status of Small-Scale Embedded Generation (SSEG) In South African Municipalities - November 2020 (SALGA), estimates total official registered SSEG installation numbers at 3 280 as of November 2020 (Figure 1), with an estimated capacity of 282 MW. However, the actual number of systems installed – registered (legal) and unregistered (illegal) – is likely to be much higher than this. Considering data uncertainties, the SALGA report estimates conservatively the total number of SSEG systems to be about 13 000, amounting to about 330 MW installed capacity in municipal distribution areas. It also acknowledges that these figures could be much higher – for example, one study in the City of Johannesburg suggest over 30 000 systems in this metro alone (PEETS 2020), and some industry experts estimates indicate totals of as much as 700 MW across the country.

# 1.3. Municipal distributor response to SSEG to date

The SALGA report shows that some municipal distributors have responded to the increasing presence of SSEGs as of November 2020, having formal SSEG application processes in place or otherwise accommodating SSEG, but $6 6 %$ (109 out of 165 licensed distributors) had not (Figure 2).

SMALL SCALE EMBEDDED GENERATION

# 1.4. Technical and revenue impact considerations for distributors

[https://youtu.be/\_HQdd6Qh31o](https://youtu.be/_HQdd6Qh31o)

D YouTube Z

Municipal distributors clearly need to respond to the growing presence of SSEG on their networks. Indeed, distributors are obliged to provide “open and non-discriminatory access” to the network for such generators (Distribution Network Code para 4(1)). On the one hand, responding positively to these developments has the potential to be of benefit to the municipality, the customer and the local economy if handled properly. On the other hand, having generators at the customer end of the network is new to many municipal distributors, and there may be concerns around safety, power quality and revenue impact from the increased presence of SSEG on their networks, amongst other things.

It has been found that the worst approach for a distributor is to do nothing – to have no application process or SSEG tariff in place. In these situations, illegal systems tend to flourish, there is no control of important technical aspects, and revenue impact is worsened – sometimes through illegally reversing meters.

# 1.5. Ready-to-use standards, specifications and approaches

Significant work has been undertaken in recent years to ensure that the necessary standards, specifications and approaches are available to enable SSEG connections in a responsible, technically sound and legal manner. In addition, SSEG tariff setting approaches have been developed which recover network costs for the distributor yet are fair to the customer and are in keeping with NERSA tariff setting principles. These approaches and documents are described later in this document.

# 1.6. Purpose of this guide

This document describes how municipal distributors can adjust to a future where SSEG is a more significant part of their network. It starts by outlining the high-level institutional and operational changes that are necessary, and then moves to the practicalities of the processes, requirements, documents, and capacity needed to accommodate SSEG onto the network without negative technical or financial impacts. It describes the documents endorsed by SALGA and the AMEU for this purpose, as well as noting the capacity building support available.

# 2\. Becoming an SSEG-ready municipal distributor: Process of change

# 2.1. Establishing the basics (first steps) and the move to full municipal SSEG readiness

There are a number of steps which can be implemented in the short term for a municipal distributor to respond to the current SSEG installation trends. These are relatively easy to do, and documentation and other support is available for this. Other measures to become fully SSEG-ready such as changes to the organogram, generally take longer. Given that the rollout of SSEG is not waiting for municipal distributor readiness, it is advisable to start with the first steps without delay. Overall, municipal readiness can be described in these categories:

# A Institutional readiness

A key first step is to develop an SSEG policy which specifies what the distributor allows, does not allow, and the application process for customers to seek permission to install. An existing AMEU-SALGA endorsed SSEG policy document can be customised for this purpose. This policy can be communicated to customers and installers as an informal guide even before it has formal approval from Council (remember that SSEG installations are usually not waiting for the distributor to be formally ready).

In the longer term, the municipal organogram should reflect SSEG (and other sustainable energy) needs, relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) may be introduced for senior staff, and an SSEG by-law amendment should be passed to make the policy legally binding on customers. SSEG policy should also be integrated with broader municipal policies, such as around climate change and the green economy.

# B Operational readiness

As a first step, the necessary documentation can relatively quickly be put in place – such a set has been developed and endorsed by AMEU and SALGA for use, including an SSEG Application Form, Technical Requirements for SSEG document (which notes all standards and specifications to be complied with), and a Commissioning Report, amongst others. In order to accept reverse feed from SSEG customers (which is recommended), bi-directional meters should be procured. Suitable SSEG tariffs should also be developed for submission to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA).

In the longer term, in addition to the above, full billing system integration of SSEG metering and tariffs is necessary, and an SSEG record keeping system should be in place. The record keeping is both to collect data on SSEG capacity, etc., which will also be required by NERSA periodically, and to note where the SSEG is on the network to ensure local hosting capacity is not exceeded (note that some municipalities use their Enterprise Management System software for such record keeping purposes).

“Establishing a basic, functioning SSEG application process can relatively easily be done by the Electricity (or Energy) Department, and is generally within their mandate.”

# C Staff readiness

As a first step, staff need to be trained in assessing SSEG applications for permission to connect using the AMEUSALGA endorsed SSEG Application form, Requirements document, etc.

In the longer term, staff should be capacitated on all aspects of SSEG, including knowing how to deal with complex, non-standard applications; specifying and assessing grid impact studies etc.

# 2.2. How to proceed?

In general, most of the first steps noted can relatively easily be mandated and achieved within the Electricity (or Energy) Department. It is beneficial however, to have full municipal buy-in for the process early on so that when policies and by-laws are presented to the Management Committee (Mancom), Portfolio Committees or Mayoral Committees, the members of these bodies are informed and are supportive. A sensible approach may therefore be:

# Start implementing the First Steps noted above, such as:

y Identify relevant staff to send on SSEG training which is available:

 SSEG technical training and SSEG application processing  SSEG tariff development training - for tariff submission to NERSA

y Customise and adopt the AMEU-SALGA endorsed SSEG documentation and forms

Submit an item for noting to Council on the Electricity (or Energy) Departmental SSEG intentions, to prepare them for future submissions.

Proceed with council submission of SSEG Policy and by-law when appropriate.

The flowchart below (Figure 3) provides more detail on the action areas in the three categories of municipal distributor readiness, together with available support resources. Step-by-step implementation information is provided in the following sections.

# 2.3. Step-by-step guide

This section provides more detail on implementing both the first steps and longer-term actions discussed earlier and notes the support available in these areas.

# Develop an SSEG policy, including the technical ‘requirements’ document

This is a good starting point for a municipal distributor. It clarifies what SSEG sizes and parameters the distributor will and will not allow, as well as the process of applying for permission to connect. It is usually in two parts:

1. Overarching SSEG Policy, setting the distributor SSEG intentions and policy principles.

2. Requirements for SSEG document, which is an appendix to the overarching policy and contains all technical parameters, standards and specifications that are to be complied, including the NRS097 series, SANS10142 and others. This document needs to be comprehensive yet clear for customers and installers. It is one of the most important documents in a municipal distributor’s SSEG process


![](https://www.salga.org.za/Documents/Knowledge-products-per-theme/Municipal-Trading-Services/images/b34c69616e0c80da004922659da7a2f96a19ff2274ed22a6be6dc61530bde82f.jpg)

The ‘Requirements’ document forms an appendix to the overarching policy because it is then easy to update as technology or legislation changes, without going through a council process.

y To make the policy legally binding for customers, a by-law amendment is necessary (see later).

# Figure 4: Overarching SSEG Policy

Note that the NRS 097-2 documents are industry specifications, not national standards, and thus are not automatically mandatory. The distributor makes them mandatory through their inclusion in policy, and enforcement of the policy via a by-law.

# NRS 097-2-1: SSEG UTILITY INTERFACE

# How to develop a process to assess and approve SSEG applications from customers

The following three documents are important in this regard:

1. SSEG Application Form – the customer and/or installer fills this in. It contains enough information for the distributor to determine if the SSEG can be connected without any negative impact.

2. Application Assessment Control Document (Checklist) – used by the municipal distributor to check all important parameters of the proposed SSEG for compliance and undertake the necessary calculations regarding potential impact on the local network. A spreadsheet version is also available, which performs these calculations automatically.

3. SSEG Commissioning Report – filled in by the customer or installer after installation is complete and signed off by a ‘Competent Person” to verify that the as-built system complies with the applicable requirements, standards and specifications. Municipalities define a ‘Competent Person’ differently, with some requiring a Pr.Eng or Pr.Tech.Eng to sign off, for example, and others allowing a suitably certified installer to do this. From a legal standpoint, both of these approaches are acceptable (see Municipal Legal Framework Applicable to Small-Scale Embedded Generation. Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr, SALGA, 2018).

# Establishing the necessary legal framework

1. It is required by law that SSEG customers sign a contract with the municipal distributor. An AMEU-SALGA endorsed contract has been developed for this purpose. It combines all the items that were previously covered in separate Connection Agreements and Supplemental Contracts.

2. An SSEG Electricity By-Law amendment is necessary to make the municipal distributors SSEG Policy legally binding for customers. This amendment does not need to be in place before SSEG applications are accepted, and many municipalities run a well-functioning SSEG process while the by-law amendment is undergoing the (often slow) formal approval and adoption process.

# Develop tariffs for SSEG

A sensible SSEG tariff will ensure that customers with SSEG continue to contribute their share of network fixed and variable costs. A balanced tariff also considers the interests of the customer and their SSEG business case. An SSEG tariff typically includes a fixed charge, variable charge, and export credit. It is recommended that export is accepted and credited by municipal distributors, as this has advantages for both the distributor (who on-sells this power at a profit) and the customer, whose business case is improved by such credit. Training on SSEG tariff setting is available, supported by a spreadsheet tool developed for this purpose. SSEG tariffs need to comply with NERSA tariff principles and rules.

Refer to Figure 8 for schematic and more information.

# Specifying and evaluating grid impact studies

Grid impact studies need to be conducted (usually by the customer) if the SSEG application assessment reveals that the parameters of the NRS097-2-3 Simplified Connection Criteria specification (which is referred to in the Requirements for SSEG policy document) have been exceeded, and therefore the potential for negative grid impact exists. Useful tools available for this are:

1. Grid Impact Study Specification Guide – allows a municipal distributor to specify the parameters and acceptable ranges to be used in such a study (such as voltages, thermal ratings, fault levels, generator rejection etc.).
2. Grid Study Check sheet – provides distributors a systematic way of assessing a grid impact study presented to them.

# Procure suitable bi-directional meters

It is generally advisable for municipal distributors to accept SSEG export onto their networks, as this has financial benefits for both the municipality and customer. Bi-directional meters are necessary for this to take place. These meters may be relatively simple and cheap or have significant ‘smart’ capabilities which can integrate with existing or planned municipal distributor smart metering (or Advanced Metering Infrastructure) functionality. Choice of meter will in part depend on the municipality’s intentions in this regard.

Refer to Figure 10 for schematic and more information.

# Communicate with your customers

Keeping customers informed about the municipal distributor’s mandatory application process, and what key requirements for SSEG are, helps with compliance. Communication should not feel ‘top down’ for the customer, but it is important to consider their perspective. Information dissemination can be through flyers with the rates bill, newspaper notices or even radio interviews, for example.

Refer to Figure 11: for schematic and more information.

# Establish an SSEG record keeping system

Municipal distributors need to establish a record keeping system for SSEG. Key SSEG parameters should be recorded such as size, type, voltage, expected energy output etc. (this information will also periodically be requested by NERSA), as well as their location on the network so that the local hosting capacity of the network can be monitored (there are limits to the amount of SSEG that can be accommodated in any one part of the network without potential negative impacts). Larger cities may use their Enterprise Management System for such record keeping (e.g. SAP). Others may adapt and use a simple spreadsheet which is available for this purpose.

Refer to Figure 12: for schematic and more information.

# Resources for more information or support

Should I allow SSEG to connect to my network?

![](https://www.salga.org.za/Documents/Knowledge-products-per-theme/Municipal-Trading-Services/images/1ba281dec2d364e7e87e5504d8fb3c98a288090042f76a60903a24a06f9513fc.jpg)

Yes. Distributors are obliged to provide open and non-discriminatory access for embedded generators to connect to the network (Distribution Network Code 4(1)). Accommodating SSEG onto the network, if done properly, can be beneficial for the distributor, the customer, and the local economy. SSEG is part of a growing trend to install renewable, af fordable energy, which is likely to continue. Distributors aren’t in control of it and should work with this trend. Not formally accepting SSEG onto the network has been found to result in more illegal installations. Trying to stop it increases the risk of grid defection.

What conditions should I put in place for SSEG wanting to connect to my network, so safety and power quality is assured?

There are a range of technical conditions that SSEG systems should comply with, including anti-islanding, maximum size limits, phase balancing etc. These are all clarified in the NRS097-2-3 and NRS097-2-1 specifications (based on the Grid Code, NRS048 etc). Requiring compliance with these specifications will ensure safety and power quality adherence.

# The AMEU-SALGA

Requirements for SSEG document includes reference to the NRS097 specifications and other necessary compliances

First, the municipality should formally adopt an SSEG Policy (e.g. the AMEU-SALGA Requirements for SSEG document)

Second, to make the Policy legally binding on customers, an SSEG Electricity By-law amendment is necessary.

By-law amendment guidance and text is provided in a legally reviewed SSEG by-law document

# Typical questions by municipal distributors

How do I make sure SSEG will not have a negative impact on my network, L especially when there are many of them?

![](https://www.salga.org.za/Documents/Knowledge-products-per-theme/Municipal-Trading-Services/images/0d274bb299a6711313dd778d455c28458f518f027f3b7f9f88c365af3b0b2924.jpg)

y As long as conditions in the NRS097-2-3 specification (Simplified Connection Criteria) are followed, SSEG can generally be connected without fear of negative network impact. This also considers the cumulative impact of many SSEGs in one area. For systems beyond limits of the NRS097-2-3, grid impact studies will be required before permission to connect can be given.

A specification for grid impact studies has been developed, and a simplified study methodology is available, as well as a video

It is best to accept reverse feed (expor t), and credit it on the customer’s bill, as it is usually beneficial for both the distributor (they on-sell this energy at a profit) and helps the customer business case (they are credited for energy exported). y The necessary bi-directional meters need to be in place to accept reverse feed.

To accept reverse feed, it is necessary to procure and install bi-directional meters.

These may be simple, or more complex and have ‘Smart’ capabilities.

Information document on bidirectional meters is available, and a video. NRS049 provides procurement guidance

# Foreword

The purpose of this document is to give guidance regarding the City of Cape Town’s requirements and application process for connecting all forms of small-scale sustainable embedded generation such as photovoltaic panels to the City’s electricity network, including both renewable energy and cogeneration.

The approval process for a small-scale embedded generation (SSEG) installation in the City varies depending on the size of the system and consumer category. This guide applies to systems with a generation capacity smaller than 1 MVA $( 1 0 0 0 \\mathsf { k V A } )$ , and all SSEG applicants up to this limit are required to comply with the conditions and process described herein. In addition, for systems over 17.3kVA an initial consultation with the City is mandatory to determine the full set of requirements before proceeding.

Note: It is important to ensure that you have the latest version of the various application forms and other relevant documents before proceeding with an SSEG application. These are available on the City’s website: [http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/electricity/Pages/ServiceApplicationForms.aspx](http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/electricity/Pages/ServiceApplicationForms.aspx)

# Glossary

# Alternating current

The flow of electrical energy that follows a sine wave and changes direction at a fixed frequency (i.e. it ‘alternates’). Most residential and commercial uses of electricity require alternating current.

# Anti-Islanding

The ability of an SSEG installation to instantly and automatically disconnect the generator from the local utility grid whenever there is a power outage in the utility grid, thus preventing the export of electricity to the utility grid from the SSEG. This is done primarily to protect utility workers who may be working on the utility grid and who may be unaware that the grid is still being energized by the SSEG.

# Bi-directional meter

A meter that separately measures electricity flow in both directions (import and export)

# Cogeneration

The generation of electricity using waste heat.

# Consumer

In the context of this document, consumers who also generate will be referred to as “consumers”, although in effect they are “consumer/generators”.

# Dedicated network

Section of the utility grid that exclusively supplies a single consumer.

# Direct Current

The flow of electrical energy in one constant direction. Direct current is typically converted to alternating current for practical purposes as most modern uses of electricity require alternating current.

# Generating capacity

The maximum amount of electricity, measured in kiloVoltAmperes (kVA), which can flow out of the generation equipment into the consumer’s alternating current wiring system. This is therefore the maximum alternating current power flow which can be generated.

# Grid-tied

An SSEG that is connected to the utility electricity grid either directly or through a consumer’s internal wiring is said to be “grid-tied”. The export of energy onto the utility grid is possible when generation exceeds consumption at any point in time. Such consumers would rely on the utility grid to supply them with electricity when their instantaneous generation is insufficient to supply their instantaneous consumption.

# Inverter

A power device that converts direct current to alternating current at a voltage and frequency which enables the generator to be connected to the utility grid.

# Isolated

A section of an electrical network which is disconnected from all other possible sources of electrical potential is said to be isolated

# Load profile

The variation of the consumers rate of electricity consumption (or demand) over time.

# Low-voltage

Voltage levels up to and including 1 kV. (1kV= 1000 Volts)

# Medium-voltage

Voltage levels greater than 1 kV up to and including $3 3 \\mathsf { k V }$ .

# Net consumer

A net consumer is someone who purchases (imports) more kWh of electricity than they export (sell) it. over any 12 month period.

# Point of Common Coupling

The nearest point on the electrical network where more than one customer is connected.

# Point of Connection

An electrical node on a distribution system where the customer’s electrical assets are physically connected to the utility’s grid (in this case the City of Cape Town’s grid)

# Pr Eng or Pr Tech Eng

This refers to a professional engineer or professional technologist who is registered with the Engineering Council of South Africa (ECSA).

# Reverse power flow

The flow of energy from the consumer electricity installation onto the utility grid (i.e. export) as a result of the instantaneous generation exceeding the instantaneous consumption at the generation site in question.

# Reverse power flow blocking

A device which prevents power flowing from an embedded generator back onto the utility grid.

# Shared network

A section of the utility grid that supplies more than one consumer.

# Small-scale embedded generator

A small-scale embedded generator for the purposes of these guidelines is an embedded generator with a generation capacity of less than 1000 kVA (1MVA).

# Stand-alone generator

A generator that is not in any way connected to the utility grid. Export of energy onto the utility grid by the generator is therefore not possible.

# The City

‘The City’ refers to The City of Cape Town and will be referred to as such throughout this document.

The electricity distribution service provider responsible for the electricity grid infrastructure to which the consumer is connected. (Both the City of Cape Town and Eskom, are responsible for portions of the electricity network within the City of Cape Town’s metropolitan boundary.)

# Utility Network (or Utility Grid)

The interconnected network of wires, transformers and other equipment, covering all voltage ranges, and belonging to the City of Cape Town which supply consumers in the City of Cape Town distribution area with electricity.

# Wheeling

The deemed transportation of electricity, over a utility’s electrical network from an SSEG to a third party electricity consumer.

# Temporary conditions relating to SSEG applications Generating licence

Existing legislation requires that anyone generating electricity “not for own use” must obtain a generating license from the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA). Clarity is still required whether feeding surplus generation back onto the utility grid and then drawing the same amount of electricity off the grid at a later stage for consumption is regarded as being “generation for own use”. In the absence of this clarity, the City will not require SSEG’s smaller than 1 MVA to obtain such a license provided that, over any consecutive 12-month period, they do not feed more electricity onto the City’s grid than they purchase from the City.

The City will register and authorise grid connection of SSEG’s up to 1 MVA without evidence of a generation license. Anyone wanting to connect 1 MVA or greater must produce a generating license or exemption letter from NERSA with their application, failing which the application will not be considered.

Consumers authorized by the City may still be required by NERSA to obtain a generating licence. Consumers are responsible directly to NERSA for obtaining a generating license and the City accepts no liability should NERSA refuse a generating license and the City subsequently withdraws registration and authorisation. The City is obliged to report to NERSA on a regular basis regarding all grid connected generation. Should NERSA refuse a generating licence the generator must be disconnected from the grid unless the consumer has received an exemption from NERSA in this regard.

Any queries requiring clarity in this area must be discussed with NERSA

# Professional Sign Off

Until such time as SANS 10142-Parts 3 (The Wiring of Premises – Embedded Generators) and 4 (The Wiring of Premises –Direct Current and Photovoltaic) are published, all embedded generation systems installed on the City of Cape Town grid must be signed off on commissioning by an ECSA registered professional engineer or technologist as complying with the City’s requirements.

# Testing of Inverters

Until such time as an SABS mark is issued for inverters, the City will require proof in the form of test certificates , of type tests having been successfully carried out by a third party test house certifying compliance of the inverters with the requirements of the City and NRS097-2-2 (see step 6 in the main document)

# 1\. Introduction

Heightened environmental awareness, dramatic increases in the price of electricity, rapidly decreasing costs of photovoltaic (PV) panels, and the risk of national power blackouts have all resulted in electricity distributors around the country being inundated with requests to allow electricity consumers to connect PV and other SSEGs to the electricity grid. Such SSEGs would be connected to the wiring on the consumer’s premises which is in turn connected to, and supplied by, the City’s electricity network – thus these generators are considered to be ‘embedded’ in the local electricity grid. One of the major advantages of such a grid

connected system is obviating the need for backup batteries which stand-alone renewable energy generators usually require.

The parallel connection of any generator to the electrical grid, however powered, has numerous implications for the local electricity utility. The most pressing are the safety of the utility staff, the public and the user of the generator. Further implications include the impact of the physical presence of the generation on neighbours (e.g. visual, noise), the impact on the quality of the local electrical supply, and metering and billing issues. There is therefore a strong need for such practice to be regulated for the general benefit and protection of citizens and manageability of the distribution network.

Consequently the City’s Electricity Supply By-law requires that anyone wanting to connect a generator to the City’s electricity grid must obtain consent from the Director of the Electricity Services Department (ESD). This document outlines the City’s requirements in this regard and lays out the associated application processes.

Although the electricity distribution industry is highly regulated, SSEG’s have not yet been adequately covered in national policy or legislation. In this void, the City has developed policies and practices which it believes are consistent with broader national policy. In particular, the City does not believe it is allowed to purchase electricity at a greater cost than it would have paid Eskom for the generated electricity. The City also does not believe consumers are permitted by national legislation to sell electricity to the City in excess of what they purchase from the City over any consecutive 12-month period.

Consumers wishing to install an SSEG and feed power back onto the utility grid are required to move onto the SSEG tariff, which includes a daily service charge in order to cover the operating costs of the utility network.

# 2\. Defining small-scale embedded generation

Small-scale embedded generation (SSEG) refers to power generation under 1MVA, such as PV systems or small wind turbines which are located on residential, commercial or industrial sites where electricity is also consumed. SSEG is in contrast to large-scale wind farms and solar parks that generate large amounts of power, typically in the multi-MegaWatt range. Most of the electricity generated by an SSEG is consumed directly at the site but times arise when generation exceeds consumption and typically a limited amount of power is allowed to flow in reverse - from the consumer onto the utility grid.

An SSEG therefore generates electricity that is “embedded” in the local electricity distribution network in that it is connected to the utility network on the consumer’s side of the utility’s electricity meter.

# 3\. Who the document is for

This Guideline is to assist consumers who wish to connect an SSEG, with generation capacity smaller than 1 MVA $\\mathsf { I O O 0 } \\mathsf { k V A } )$ , to the City’s electricity grid. It is intended to provide guidance in this regard to:

 SSEG project developers

Commercial and Industrial building owners

Residential buildings owners

SSEG installers

Energy consultants commissioned to design SSEG systems

City officials involved in SSEG generation

Professional Engineers or Technologists involved in SSEG commissioning

It is essential that all consumers wishing to install an SSEG, regardless of generation capacity, complete the relevant sections of the application process in full, and that written approval is received from the City before system installation commences. The City needs to ensure that, amongst other considerations, the SSEG installation can be accommodated on the electrical network and that the total SSEG generation capacity of the network has not been exceeded. Equipment should therefore not be purchased prior to obtaining written approval from the City as approval is not guaranteed and the City will not be held liable for equipment expenses where approval is denied.

For commercial and industrial systems in particular an initial consultation with the City to determine the full set of requirements is highly recommended prior to submission of the application form..

This document does not apply to those who wish to install a system with generation capacity of greater than 1 MVA (1000 kVA). For such systems a meeting should be arranged with the City in order to establish the necessary requirements and application process. Anyone wanting to connect 1 MVA or greater will not be able to connect under the conditions of these guidelines. In addition a generating licence or exemption letter from NERSA will be required before connection is considered.

# Eskom consumers

Consumers residing in Cape Town, but located in Eskom’s area of supply, need to apply to Eskom for consent to connect SSEG to the electrical grid.

# Stand-alone generators

Generators that are not connected to the electricity grid in any way, and are thus ‘standalone’ generators, do not need permission from the City’s ESD. However, approvals from other City departments are still necessary, such as from the Planning and Building Development Management Department. It is the responsibility of the prospective standalone generator installer or owner to directly obtain these necessary approvals.

# 4\. SSEG systems not permitted

# Net generators are not permitted

a. SSEGs can either be “net consumers” or “net generators”: “Net consumers” on average (over a one year period) purchase more electricity from the utility than they feed back onto the utility grid.

b. “Net generators” on average (over a one year period) purchase less electricity from the utility than they feed back onto the utility grid.

SSEGs which are net generators are not permitted by the City, and these guidelines therefore apply only to net consumers.

As mentioned in the introduction, the City does not believe it has a legal mandate to purchase electricity, on average taken over any consecutive 12-month period, in excess of what it sells to the consumer in question.

# Transfer of power to a different location is not permitted:

The power produced by the SSEG must be utilised on the property on which the generator is located, or fed onto the utility network for purchase by the City. The following are not permissible:

Installation on a different property to where the power is used (e.g. installing solar PV panels on a neighbour’s house roof)

Supplying power from an SSEG on your premises to another premises (e.g. selling power to neighbours or to another premises elsewhere in the city). This is also known as wheeling.

# 5\. SSEG system decommissioning

The City of Cape Town requires notice of any SSEG system which has been decommissioned.

An SSEG system which has been decommissioned must be physically disconnected from the grid at the consumer’s cost by the removal of wiring which connects the inverter/s with the grid.

The Decommissioning Report in Appendix 5 of this document must be completed and submitted to the relevant DSD office (contact details in ‘Step 4’ of application process described later on in these guidelines).

# 6\. Change of property ownership

When transfer of ownership of a property takes place which has SSEG installed, the new owner will be required to sign a new Supplemental Contract or alternatively the SSEG system must be decommissioned as detailed in paragraph 5 above

The Certificate of Compliance which is required to be issued as a condition of transfer of ownership of the property must include a statement regarding the state of connection or disconnection.

At the time that the CONSUMER ceases to be on the SSEG tariff, any remaining credit balance will be refunded to the CONSUMER on written request provided that the CONSUMER has no other outstanding municipal debt.

# SECTION A: RESIDENTIAL

SMALL-SCALE EMBEDDED GENERATORS

# 1\. General Requirements: Residential

# 1.1. Generation size limitations

The generation size limits for residential consumers wishing to install an SSEG are detailed below:

Table 1. Residential SSEG size limitations as derived from NRS 097-2-3

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service connection |  |
| No. of Phases\* | Service Circuit BreakerSize (A) | Maximum Total GenerationCapacity\*\* of SSEG (kVA\*\*\*) |
| 1 | 40 | 2.3 |
| 1 | 60 | 3.5 |
| 1 | 80 | 4.6 |
| 3 | 40 | 6.9 |
| 3 | 60 | 10.4 |
| 3 | 80 | 13.9 |
| 3 | 100 | 17.3 |

\\* To determine if you have a single-phase or three-phase connection, check the main circuit-breaker on the distribution board. A single-phase supply will generally have a single main circuit-breaker, and a three-phase a triple main circuit-breaker. If in doubt consult an electrician.

\\*\\* Generation Capacity refers to the total output capacity of the generator. For PV systems in particular, this refers to the maximum output of the inverter. Due to system losses this is typically 10 to $20 %$ lower than the maximum output of the PV panels, which is specified in DC kilo-Watt-peak (kWp). The system designer/installer will provide guidance here.

\\*\\*\\* kVA and kW ratings for SSEG’s are similar in most cases and can be used interchangeably for estimation purposes.

Note: The generation size limits in the table apply to normal residential connections on a shared low-voltage (LV) network. Consumers who wish to apply for an installation with a generation capacity exceeding the limits in the above table must consult with ESD before commencing.

Note: If SSEG generation capacity is 4.6 kVA or less, a single-phase inverter can be installed even if the consumer has a three-phase connection. However, it is the responsibility of the consumer to ensure that their load is balanced across all three phases. A qualified electrician, engineer or technologist should be consulted here.

# 1.2. Electricity Generation Licences

Presently, consumers wishing to install an SSEG with a generation capacity of less than 1000 kVA are not required by the City to obtain a generating license from NERSA before consent is given by the City to connect to the electricity grid. Consumers authorized by the City may still be required by NERSA to obtain a generation licence. Such consumers are responsible directly to NERSA for obtaining a generation licence and the City accepts no liability should NERSA refuse a generation license and the City suspends registration and authorisation. The City is obliged to report to NERSA on a regular basis regarding all grid connected generation. Should NERSA refuse a generation license the generator must be disconnected from the grid unless the consumer has received an exemption from NERSA in this regard.

# 1.3. Metering and Tariffs

Residential consumers may adopt one of two approaches to connecting SSEG to the grid:

i. Consumers wanting to connect SSEG to the grid without being compensated for reverse power flow will be required to install reverse power flow blocking protection to prevent reverse power flow onto the electricity grid. The consumers may then, subject to the ruling policies for tariffs and metering, keep their existing meter and remain on the relevant electricity consumption tariff. In other words, for this option the conventional credit or prepayment meter is NOT allowed to run backwards.

ii. Residential consumers installing SSEG who wish to participate in the SSEG tariff must have a bi-directional AMI credit meter installed. The City will provide and install the requisite meters at the consumer’s cost. The SSEG tariff is only available to consumers who are “net consumers” and it is specifically not available for consumers who are “net generators”. In order to qualify for the Residential SSEG tariff consumers must have excess (net) generation to regularly require the facility to feed excess power back onto the municipal grid. It will be at the Electricity Services Department’s discretion to decide whether consumers will be allowed on the residential SSEG tariff. Consumers may be moved off the tariff if they do not have sufficient regular excess (net) generation They will be required at their own cost to install reverse power flow blocking protection and a prepayment meter and they will forfeit any expenditure they incurred on having bi-directional metering installed.

Consumers (with single or three phase supplies) wishing to participate in the SSEG tariff must have a meter box installed on the property boundary if such facility does not currently exist.

Tariffs are determined annually by the City and are subject to approval by NERSA. The current tariffs are to be found on the City’s website: [http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/electricity/Pages/ElectricityTariffs.aspx](http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/electricity/Pages/ElectricityTariffs.aspx)

The applicable SSEG tariff is the Residential small-scale embedded generation tariff and comprises:

 A daily service charge

 An electricity consumption charge per kWh consumed

 A rate per kWh at which the City will purchase residential excess generation

The daily service charge along with charges for consumption and credits for generated electricity fed onto the utility network will be billed monthly (as is done for other City services e.g. water and rates).

\\* \- these tariffs are given as an example. Please check the City website for the current tariffs \*\*- this amount has no VAT added as residential consumers are not VAT registered Note: For residential consumers, payment for excess generation will exclude VAT.

# 1.4. Load profile management

The SSEG tariff has been structured in such a way that consumers will find it most beneficial, from a financial and practical point of view, to ensure that they utilise as much of the generated electricity as they can and avoid or minimise reverse power flow. For example, where a PV system is installed, loads should be shifted to occur during the middle of the day when generation is typically at its highest – when the sun is shining. This means that consumers should arrange that loads such as pool pumps, geysers etc. are switched on during this time – from mid-morning to mid-afternoon (roughly from 10:00 until 15:00) when PV generation is at a maximum, and are off after sunset. Grid studies

Under normal circumstances grid studies are not required for the connection of a residential SSEG that is within the limits detailed in Table 1 above.

# 1.5. Who pays for what

The residential consumer is responsible for all the costs involved in the supply and installation of meters.

 The consumer will be responsible for the cost of any specialist grid studies (although such studies are unlikely in the case of residential SSEG installations). The consumer will be responsible for any changes required to the utility network upstream of the connection point as a result of the SSEG installation (although the need for such changes is unlikely).

 The consumer will be responsible for all the costs associated with specialist tests that need to be carried out, e.g. Inverter testing, as well as for obtaining the required certification of the design and installation as detailed below.

# 1.6. Applicable technical standards

Most of the technical requirements for SSEG’s are covered in the following standards and guidelines (note that these do not necessarily cover all requirements for SSEG systems - see Appendix 1 for the complete list):

1. NRS 097-2: Grid interconnection of embedded generation: Part 2 Small scale embedded generation
2. South African Renewable Power Plant Grid Code

The above standards cover aspects such as voltage range; flicker; DC injection; frequency operating range; harmonics and waveform distortion; power factor; synchronization; safe disconnection from the network; overvoltage and undervoltage; sudden voltage dips and peaks; voltage change; overfrequency and underfrequency; anti-islanding; DC current injection; network faults; response to utility recovery; isolation; earthing; short-circuit protection; labelling.

The design and installation of all SSEG equipment, will need to comply with these requirements. Consult with your supplier and/or installer to ensure that these conditions are met.

# 1.7. How to apply for permission to install SSEG

The SSEG application is made by completing the GEN/EMB application form1, available on the City’s website. The text box below highlights some important points to consider prior to applying. Figure 1 that follows outlines the application process:

Purchasing your equipment: SSEG equipment that is to connect to the grid must comply with the City’s requirements. It is therefore important for consumers to be familiar with these requirements before purchasing the equipment. This is of particular relevance to the inverter. Specific technical information and certificates are required for submission with the initial application form. It is the responsibility of the consumer to ensure that equipment complies with the required standards.

Where there is no existing electricity service connection: Where an SSEG is to be connected at a location where there is currently no connection to the utility network, an application for a new electricity supply should be submitted simultaneously as a separate document to the SSEG application form. This application form can be found at: [https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/electricity/Pages/ServiceApplicationForms.aspx](https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/electricity/Pages/ServiceApplicationForms.aspx)

Future expansion: Consent to connect the SSEG to the electricity grid is only granted for the declared generation capacity. Consumers wishing to increase the capacity of their generation or make changes to their current installation must obtain approval for the expansion or change. Application must again be made through the submission of a completed GEN/EMB application form. It is important that the consumer remains a ‘net consumer’.

Professional sign off: The final installed SSEG system must be signed off on commissioning as complying with the City’s requirements by a professional engineer or technologist registered with ECSA. For more information regarding professional personnel, visit: [https://www.ecsa.co.za/default.aspx](https://www.ecsa.co.za/default.aspx)

Figure 1: Summary of SSEG application and approval process.

# STEP 1: VISIT CITY WEBSITE

Visit the City’s website and download the GEN/EMB2 application form as noted above.

Alternatively, the GEN/EMB form is obtainable from the Consumer Support Services offices listed lower down in Step 4. The form requires both basic and technical information of the proposed SSEG project to ensure that all SSEG connections are made safely and legally and in compliance with all requirements.

# STEP 2: COMPLETE GEN/EMB APPLICATION FORM

The City requires that the application form be signed by the property owner. Details of the proposed installer must also be provided. The property owner may need support from the proposed installer or a professional in completing the application form (information required includes type of energy conversion, the total generating capacity of the SSEG, electrical parameters, expected consumption, network connection point, synchronising method, antiislanding method and generator control method amongst others (not all information is relevant for all generation system types).

Details in the GEN/EMB form that will need particular consideration:

Preliminary design: a simple circuit diagram showing major system components and the point of common coupling (PCC) must be provided.

Earthing arrangement: this must be in accordance to SANS 10142-1. Earthing requirements for typical earthing systems are described in NRS 097-2-1.

Various electrical parameters of the system: these sections require information on the electrical specifications of the SSEG system. Not all sections are applicable to all SSEG types.

System protection detail: this includes information about the synchronizing method, anti-islanding, power quality etc.

Proposed peak power generation output: maximum power expected to be generated must be detailed in the application form. This must be within the maximum power limits given earlier in this document.

# STEP 3: OBTAIN PERMISSION FROM OTHER CITY DEPARTMENTS

The Electricity Services Department will require prior approval of the proposed SSEG installation from other City departments such as Planning and Building Development Management, City Health and Specialised Services before it will consider applications to connect to the grid. All applicable approvals must be reflected in the relevant sections of the GEN/EMB application form.

Note that photovoltaic (PV) SSEG applications will require approval from only Planning and Building Development Management in this step.

Requirements of these departments are summarised in the Appendix 2: Approval from other Departments.

# STEP 4: SUBMIT COMPLETED APPLICATION FORM AND ATTACHMENTS

Once the GEN/EMB form has been completed and consent has been obtained from the other relevant City departments the form must be submitted to the relevant ESD area in which the project is located. The table below shows the different area offices.

The Distribution System Development (DSD) section, a unit within the City’s ESD, will then process the application.

# STEP 5: INSTALLATION COMMENCEMENT UPON APPROVAL

After due consideration of the application, the applicant will be informed in writing whether the application has been successful. Once notified of a successful application, the applicant may commence installation.

# STEP 6: COMMISSIONING AND DOCUMENTATION TO BE SUBMITTED TO DSD

Once fully installed, the system is ready for testing and commissioning by the SSEG installer. Note that permanent connection of the SSEG system to the electricity grid is only permitted on receipt of written permission from the City. However the SSEG may connect to the utility grid for the commissioning process only, whereafter it must once again be disconnected until written approval is granted by the City.

Commissioning of the system must be undertaken by a Pr Eng or Pr Tech Eng, who must complete and sign off the SSEG Commissioning Report (Appendix 4).

In addition to the Commissioning Report, the following documentation must also be completed

Final copy of circuit diagram

Inverter Type Test

The inverter type test certification requirements are specified in the NRS 097-2-1. Type testing is to be undertaken by a $3 ^ { \\mathsf { r d } }$ party test house such as Bureau Veritas, KEMA or TÜV Rheinland. Inverter suppliers should be asked to provide the necessary

certification before the equipment is purchased. It is strongly recommended that the City be consulted before equipment is purchased to ensure its acceptability by the City.

Factory setting sheet or other documentation showing that the inverter has been set according to NRS 097-2-1

An electrical installation Certificate of Compliance as per SANS 10142-1

A signed Supplemental Contract for Embedded Generation This is a legally required contract that governs the relationship between the City and the consumer. The contract is valid for as long as the project is in existence (see Appendix 3: Supplementary Supply Contract)

Operation and Maintenance Procedure – installation responsibilities after commissioning.

All completed documentation must be submitted to the relevant DSD office.

# STEP 7: INSPECTION OF INSTALLATION IF NECESSARY

The City may inspect the installation if required, although this is unlikely in the case of a residential application.

# STEP 8: APPROVAL GRANTED TO CONNECT TO THE GRID AND GENERATION COMMENCES

If all of the above is satisfactory, the City will install the necessary meters. Approval to connect SSEG to the grid is provided by the DSD to the consumer, in writing, together with any operation and decommissioning requirements deemed necessary. Once this is done, the change to the tariff will be implemented where applicable.

# STEP 9: REPEAT THE PROCESS IN THE CASE OF SSEG CAPACITY EXPANSION

Should an expansion or a change to the system be required, a new application must be completed.

Note: Any queries regarding any matter regarding SSEG must be referred to the relevant DSD area office as listed in STEP 4 above

# SECTION B:

# COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL

SMALL-SCALE EMBEDDED GENERATORS

# 2\. General Requirements: Commercial and Industrial

# 2.1. Generation size limitations

This document does not cover systems over 1MVA (1000kVA).

 All LV commercial and industrial consumers planning to install SSEG systems under 1MVA must comply with the sizing limitations specified in NRS 097-2-3. MV commercial and industrial consumers planning to install SSEG systems under 1MVA may require a bespoke engineering study to determine the impact of the proposed SSEG system size on the network.

# 2.2. Electricity Generation Licences

Presently, consumers wishing to install an SSEG with a generation capacity of less than 1000 kVA are not required by the City to obtain a generating license from NERSA before consent is given by the City to connect to the electricity grid. Consumers authorized by the City may still be required by NERSA to obtain a generation licence. Such consumers are responsible directly to NERSA for obtaining a generation licence and the City accepts no liability should NERSA refuse a generation license and the City suspends registration and authorisation. The City is obliged to report to NERSA on a regular basis regarding all grid connected generation. Should NERSA refuse a generation license the generator must be disconnected from the grid unless the consumer has received an exemption from NERSA in this regard.

# 2.3. Metering

Commercial and industrial consumers wanting to connect SSEG to the grid and to be compensated for reverse power flow, require a bi-directional AMI credit meter. This includes consumers currently using prepayment meters. The City will provide and install the necessary meters at the consumer’s cost.

Consumers wanting to connect SSEG to the grid but not be compensated for reverse power flow will be required to install reverse power flow blocking protection to prevent reverse power flow onto the electricity grid. The consumers may then, subject to the ruling policies for tariffs and metering, keep their existing meter and remain on the relevant electricity consumption tariff. In other words, for this option conventional credit or prepayment meters are NOT allowed to run backwards.

Consumers (with single or three phase supplies) wishing to participate in the SSEG tariff must have a meter box installed on the property boundary if such facility is does not currently exist.

# 2.4. Tariffs

Consumers on tariffs which have a daily service charge will see no difference to the tariff other than the addition of a generation credit component which is simply a rate/kWh exported.

Tariffs are determined annually by the City and are subject to approval by NERSA. SSEG applicants should check the City’s website for the latest tariffs - the applicable tariff is the commercial and industrial small-scale embedded generation tariff and can be found here: [http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/electricity/Pages/ElectricityTariffs.aspx](http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/electricity/Pages/ElectricityTariffs.aspx)

Note that commercial consumers with a prepayment meter on the SPU 2 tariff will be changed to SPU 1 tariff and will require a bi-directional AMI credit meter unless they install reverse power flow blocking protection.

VAT will only be payable by the City on the purchase by the City of excess electricity if the consumer is a registered VAT vendor with SARS.

In terms of Interpretation Note number 56 (dated 31 March 2010) of the Value-added Tax Act (number 89 of 1991) consumers will not have to submit invoices to the City for payment by the City for excess generation.

# 2.5. Load Profile Management

The SSEG tariff has been structured in such a way that consumers will find it most beneficial to ensure that they utilise as much of the generated electricity as they can and avoid or minimise reverse power flow. For example, where a PV system is installed, electrical loads should be shifted to occur during the middle of the day when generation is typically at its highest – from mid-morning to mid-afternoon (roughly from 10:00 until 15:00).

# 2.6. Grid Studies

Should the generation site not meet the criteria for a simplified utility connection for an LV connected SSEG in terms of NRS 097-2-3, grid studies may be necessary and will be carried out at the SSEG applicant’s cost.

# 2.7. Who pays for what

 The commercial and industrial consumer is responsible for all the costs involved in the supply and installation of meters.

 The consumer will be responsible for the cost of any specialist grid studies.

 The consumer will be responsible for any changes required to the utility network upstream of the connection point as a result of the SSEG installation.

 The consumer will be responsible for all the costs associated with specialist tests that need to be carried out, e.g. Inverter testing, as well as for obtaining the required certification of the design and the installation as detailed below.

# 2.8. Applicable technical standards

Most of the technical requirements for SSEG’s are covered in the following standards and guidelines (note that these do not necessarily cover all requirements for SSEG systems - see Appendix 1 for the complete list):

1. NRS 097-2: Grid interconnection of embedded generation: Part 2 Small scale embedded generation
2. South African Renewable Power Plant Grid Code

The above standards cover aspects such as voltage range; flicker; DC injection; frequency operating range; harmonics and waveform distortion; power factor; synchronization; safe disconnection from the network; overvoltage and undervoltage; sudden voltage dips and peaks; voltage change; overfrequency and underfrequency; anti-islanding; DC current injection; network faults; response to utility recovery; isolation; earthing; short-circuit protection; labelling.

The design and installation of all SSEG equipment will need to comply with these requirements. Consult your supplier and/or installer to ensure that these conditions are met.

# 2.9 How to apply for permission to install SSEG

The SSEG application is made by completing the GEN/EMB application form3, available on the City’s website. The text box below highlights some important points to consider prior to applying. Figure 1 that follows outlines the application process:

Purchasing your equipment: SSEG equipment that is to connect to the grid must comply with the City’s requirements. It is therefore important for consumers to be familiar with these requirements before purchasing the equipment. This is of particular relevance to the inverter. Specific technical information and certificates are required for submission with the initial application form. It is the responsibility of the consumer to ensure that equipment complies with the required standards.

Where there is no existing electricity service connection: Where an SSEG is to be connected at a location where there is currently no connection to the utility network, an application for a new electricity supply should be submitted simultaneously as a separate document to the SSEG application form. This application form can be found here: [https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/electricity/Pages/ServiceApplicationForms.aspx](https://www.capetown.gov.za/en/electricity/Pages/ServiceApplicationForms.aspx)

Future expansion: Consent to connect the SSEG to the electricity grid is only granted for the declared generation capacity. Consumers wishing to increase the capacity of their generation or make changes to their current installation must obtain approval for the expansion or change. Application must again be made through the submission of a completed GEN/EMB application form. It is important that the consumer remains a ‘net consumer’.

Figure 2: Summary of SSEG application and approval process

# STEP 1: VISIT CITY WEBSITE

Visit the City’s website and download the GEN/EMB4 application form as noted above. Alternatively, the GEN/EMB form is obtainable from the Consumer Support Services offices listed lower down. The form requires both basic and technical information of the proposed SSEG project to ensure that all SSEG connections are done safely and legally and in compliance with all requirements. Information required includes type of energy conversion, the total generating capacity of the SSEG, electrical parameters, expected consumption, network connection point, synchronising method, anti-islanding method and generator control method amongst others (not all information is relevant for all generation system types).

# STEP 2: COMPLETE GEN/EMB APPLICATION FORM

The City requires that the application form be signed by the property owner. Details of the proposed installer must also be provided. The property owner may need support from the proposed installer or a professional in completing the application form.

After due consideration of the application, the applicant will be informed in writing whether the application has been successful. Once notified of a successful application, the applicant may commence installation.

# STEP 6: COMMISSIONING AND DOCUMENTATION TO BE SUBMITTED TO DSD

Once fully installed, the system is ready for testing and commissioning by the SSEG installer. Note that permanent connection of the SSEG system to the electricity grid is only permitted on receipt of written permission from the City. However the SSEG may connect to the utility grid for the commissioning process only, whereafter it must once again be disconnected until written approval is granted by the City.

Commissioning of the system must be undertaken by a Pr Eng or Pr Tech Eng, who must complete and sign off the SSEG Commissioning Report (Appendix 4).

In addition to the Commissioning Report, the following documentation must also be completed

Final copy of circuit diagram Inverter Type Test The inverter type test certification requirements are specified in the NRS 097-2-1. Type testing is to be undertaken by a $3 ^ { \\mathsf { r d } }$ party test house such as Bureau Veritas, KEMA or TÜV Rheinland. Inverter suppliers should be asked to provide the necessary certification before the equipment is purchased. It is strongly recommended that the City be consulted before equipment is purchased to ensure its acceptability by the City. Factory setting sheet or other documentation showing that the inverter has been set according to NRS 097-2-1  An electrical installation Certificate of Compliance as per SANS 10142-1 A signed Supplemental Contract for Embedded Generation This is a legally required contract that governs the relationship between the City and the consumer. The contract is valid for as long as the project is in existence (see Appendix 3: Supplementary Supply Contract) Operation and Maintenance Procedure – installation responsibilities after commissioning.

All completed documentation must be submitted to the relevant DSD office.

# STEP 7: INSPECTION OF INSTALLATION IF NECESSARY

The City may inspect the installation if deemed necessary.

# STEP 8: APPROVAL GRANTED TO CONNECT TO THE GRID AND GENERATION COMMENCES

If all of the above is satisfactory, the City will install the necessary meters if required, SSEG approval to connect to the grid is provided by the DSD to the consumer, in writing, together with any operation and decommissioning requirements. Once this is done, monthly billing will begin.

# STEP 9: REPEAT THE PROCESS IN THE CASE OF SSEG CAPACITY EXPANSION

Should an expansion or a change to the system be required, a new application must be completed.

Note: Any queries regarding any matter regarding SSEG must be referred to the relevant DSD area office as listed in STEP 4 above

# Appendix 1: Relevant Standards and Regulations

The City requires that SSEG installations comply with the necessary standards and regulations in order for the system to be approved and put into commission. This section provides an overview of these legislative requirements. The Professional Engineer / Technologist will highlight aspects most applicable to the SSEG system in question.

# List of Standards and Regulations

There are a number of standards and regulations that the project developer has to be aware of. The most relevant standards and regulations that must be complied with are:

Electricity Regulation Act, Act 4 of 2006 and Electricity Regulation Amendment Act,

28 of 2007 as amended

South African Distribution Code (all parts)

South African Grid Code (all parts)

South African Renewable Power Plants Grid Code

Occupational Health and Safety Act 1993 as amended

City of Cape Town Electricity Supply By-Law

SANS 10142- Parts 1 to 4: The Wiring of Premises

SANS 474/ NRS 057 Code of Practice for Electricity Metering

NRS 048: Electricity Supply– Quality of Supply

NRS 097-1: Code of Practice for the interconnection of embedded generation to

electricity distribution networks: Part 1 MV and HV (Eskom 240-61268576 / DST 34-1765:

Standard for the interconnection of embedded generation, is applicable until

published)

NRS 097-2: Grid interconnection of embedded generation: Part 2 Small scale

embedded generation

Guidance on their applicability and coverage is given below.

# Standards of Importance

Of the compliance standards and regulations stated above, two of these standards are the most important for embedded generation, namely:

1. NRS 097-2: Grid interconnection of embedded generation: Part 2 Small scale embedded generation
2. South African Renewable Power Plants Grid Code

These two set the majority of regulatory requirements in order for compliance to be granted by the City for the installation and operation of an SSEG and therefore should be consulted with care. This section will provide an overview of key aspects of both documents. These overviews should be seen only as summaries, and the standards themselves will need to be referred to for a complete picture. Applicants will require assistance from their installer and professional engineer/technologist to ensure full compliance.

# NRS 097-2-1 (Part 2: Small Scale Embedded Generation, Section 1)

This document serves as the standard for the interconnection of SSEG’s to the utility network and applies to embedded generators smaller than 1000kVA connected to LV networks of type single, dual or three-phase.

NRS 097-2-3 (Part 2: Small Scale Embedded Generation, Section 3) This document provides simplified utility connection criteria for low-voltage connected generators.

# South African Renewable Power Plants Grid Code (SARPPGC)

This document sets out the technical and design grid connection requirements for renewable power plants (RPP) to connect to the transmission or distribution network in South Africa. This guideline is of concern to embedded generators of Category A that are connected to a low-voltage (LV) network.

# i) Category A: 0 – 1 MVA (Only LV connected RPPs)

This category includes RPPs with rated power of less than 1 MVA and connected to the LV voltage (typically called 'small or micro turbines'). This category shall further be divided into 3 sub-categories:

# ii) Category A1: 0 - 13.8 kVA

This sub-category includes RPPs of Category A with rated power in the range of 0 to $1 3 . 8 \\mathsf { k V A }$ .

iii) Category A2: 13.8 kVA – 100 kVA

This sub-category includes RPPs of Category A with rated power in the range greater than 13.8 kVA but less than 100 kVA.

# iv) Category A3: 100 kVA – 1 MVA

This sub-category includes RPPs of Category A with rated power in the range 100 kVA but less than 1 MVA. Note: RPPs with a rated power greater than 4.6 kVA must be balanced threephase.

# Other Standards and Legislation

Electricity Regulation Act, Act 4 of 2006 (ERA)

All applicants should familiarize themselves with the ERA. The act states that no person may, without a license issued by the regulator (NERSA), operate any generation facility. The ERA holds that exemption is held for non-grid-tied projects. Note that NERSA has issued a communication giving license exemption to SSEG installations in municipal areas under 100kW.

# South African Distribution Code

The South African Distribution Code applies to all entities connected to the distribution network, including EGs. It sets the basic rules for connecting to the distribution network, ensures non-discrimination to all users connected to the distribution network and specifies the technical requirements to ensure the safety and reliability of the distribution network. A more detailed guideline pertaining to the connection of SSEG’s to the utility network and the specific requirements involved is found in the NRS 097-2-1.

# South African Grid Code

The South African Grid Code contains the connection conditions that are required by all generators, distributors and end-users (consumers) connected to the utility grid, as well as the standards used to plan and develop the transmission system. Page 5 of the Network Code provides a summary of the grid code requirements applicable to specific ratings of nonhydro units, while page 6 provides those for hydro units. For SSEG’s the requirements for ratings below 20 MVA should be adhered to accordingly as per the South African Grid Code.

# Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993

The Occupational Health and Safety Act provides for the health and safety of the people by ensuring that all undertakings are conducted in such a manner so that those who are, or who may be, directly affected by such an activity are not negatively harmed as far as possible and are not exposed to dangers to their health and safety.

# City of Cape Town Electricity Supply By-Law

This document provides the general conditions of supply of electricity, outlines the responsibility of the consumers, systems of supply, measurement of electricity and the electrical contractors responsibilities.

# SANS 10142-1 The Wiring of Premises - Low-voltage installations

This document serves as the South African national standard for the wiring of premises in lowvoltage networks. The aim of the document is to ensure that people, animals and property are protected from dangers that arise during normal as well as fault conditions, due to the operation of an electrical installation. Compliance to the standards and regulations as laid out SANS 10142-1 is required and proof should be provided via an electrical installation certificate of compliance. The implication is that a qualified electrician is required to sign off on your system.

SANS 10142-2 The Wiring of Premises - Medium-Voltage installations above 1 kV a.c. not exceeding $2 2 \ k V$ a.c. and up to and including 3 000 kW installed capacity

This document serves as the South African national standard for the wiring of premises in medium-voltage networks. The aim of the document is to ensure that people, animals and property are protected from dangers that arise during normal as well as fault conditions, due to the operation of an electrical installation. Compliance to the standards and regulations as laid out SANS 10142-2 is required and proof should be provided via an electrical installation certificate of compliance. The implication is that a qualified electrician is required to sign off on your system.

SANS 10142-3 The Wiring of Premises – LV Embedded Generator Code (once published)

SANS 10142-4 The Wiring of Premises – Direct Current and Photovoltaic wiring guide (once published)

# SANS 474 / NRS 057 Code of Practice for Electricity Metering

SANS 474 specifies the metering procedures, standards and other such requirements that must be adhered to by electricity licensees and their agents. It refers specifically to new and existing metering installations for the purpose of billing. It further specifies the initial calibration and certification requirements as well as compliance testing of metering installations and the subsequent procedures to ensure continued compliance. It specifies the procedures for the manipulation and storage of metering data and sets a standard format for the numbering of electricity meters.

For more specific details with regard to the metering for SSEG purposes, NRS 097-2-1 should be consulted and the requirements as defined by the City must be adhered to.

# NRS 048

The NRS 048 series covers the quality of supply parameters, specifications and practices that must be undertaken to ensure correct and safe operation. The NRS 048-2 and NRS 048-4 have the most relevance to the operation and connection of SSEG’s to the utility network:

NRS 048-2: ‘Voltage characteristics, compatibility levels, limits and assessment methods’ sets the standards and compatibility levels for the quality of supply for utility connections as well as for stand-alone systems. It is intended that generation licensees ensure compliance with the compatibility levels set in this document under normal operating conditions.

NRS 048-4: ‘Application guidelines for utilities’ sets the technical standards and guidelines for the connection of new consumers. It also sets the technical procedures for the evaluation of existing consumers with regards to harmonics, voltage unbalance and voltage flicker.

# Appendix 2: City Department Approvals

# Planning and Building Development Management

# Roof top installations

No building plans are required to be submitted provided the panel(s) in its installed position does not project more than $1 . 5 \\mathsf { m }$ , measured perpendicularly, above the roof and/or not more than 600mm above the highest point of the roof.

Full building plans, including an engineer’s endorsement, are required if the panel(s) in its installed position;

Project more than 1.5 metres in its installed position measured perpendicularly, above the roof and/or; Projects more than 600mm above the highest point of the roof.

A relaxation in terms of the Zoning Scheme Regulations is also required under either one or both of the above circumstances.

# Installations on the ground

No building plans are required to be submitted provided the panel(s) in its installed position does not project more than 2.1 metres above the natural/finished ground level.

Full building plans are required where any part of the installation projects more than 2.1 metres above the ground level.

# Other installations

Clearance required for other embedded generation such as wind.

# Health and Air Quality Approvals

Air Quality and Mechanical Engineering (Noise) Units do not need to be consulted with SSEG applications where diesel fuelled mechanical engine generator are not part of the installation.

Should a mechanical engine which burns fuel or generates noise be incorporated in the installation, such applications should be referred to City Health.

# Environmental Approvals

Large-scale PV installations would require environmental authorisation (EA) in terms of the NEMA 2010 EIA Regulations if they generate $>$ 10 MW electricity, or ${ < } 1 0$ MW but cover an area of 1ha or more.

Electrical transmission infrastructure that may be associated with a large scale PV system would require EA if it has a capacity of $2 7 5 \\mathsf { k V }$ or more within an urban area, or more than 33kV outside urban areas.

The Cape Town International Airport would count as inside an urban area.

Large scale roll-out of SSEG PV would not require EA. There may however be heritage compliance issues in some areas of the City.

Household installation of PV would not require an EA unless it exceeds the electricity generation threshold mentioned above, which is highly unlikely.
