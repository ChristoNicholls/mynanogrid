## Factors Influencing the Solar Panel Prices and Solar PV Prices

When considering the installation of a solar power system, it’s important to understand the various factors that can influence the overall cost. These factors ensure that each solar installation is unique to the homeowner’s needs and property specifics. Here are some key aspects that affect the pricing:

- **System Size and Capacity:** The size of the solar system, typically measured in kilowatts (kW), is one of the primary determinants of cost. Larger systems with higher capacity are more expensive due to the increased number of solar panels and additional hardware required.
- **Type and Quality of Solar Panels:** There are different types of solar panels (like monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film), each with varying efficiency and costs. Higher-efficiency panels are usually more expensive but can be more cost-effective in the long run.
- **Inverter Type:** The inverter is a critical component that converts solar energy into usable electricity. The type (string inverters, microinverters, or hybrid inverters) and quality of the inverter can significantly impact the cost.
- **Battery Storage:** Adding a battery storage system allows for the storage of excess solar energy, which can be used when the sun isn’t shining. The inclusion of a battery system increases the initial investment but can offer greater energy independence and savings.
- **Installation Complexity:** The complexity of the installation process can vary based on the property. Factors like roof type, angle, and accessibility, as well as any special installation requirements, can affect the overall cost.
- **Location and Climate:** Geographic location influences the amount of sunlight available for solar energy production. Additionally, local climate conditions can affect the type of equipment needed and the installation process.
- **Government Incentives and Rebates:** The South African National Treasury has set forth guidelines for accessing the ZAR4 billion rebate program for residential solar PV systems, initiated in February. Homeowners can receive a 25% rebate on solar panel costs, capped at ZAR16500. In the 2023/24 filing season, PAYE taxpayers can claim this rebate, and provisional taxpayers can apply it against their provisional and final payments. Eligibility requires a VAT invoice detailing the solar panel costs and proof of payment. Furthermore, for systems purchased between March 1, 2023, and February 29, 2026, a compliance certificate with the 2009 Electrical Installation Regulations is mandatory. The rebate covers solar panels in new or existing systems with at least 275 W output, excluding portable panels.
- **Labor Costs:** The cost of professional installation varies by region and the expertise of the installers. Choosing certified and experienced installers ensures system efficiency and safety, which might come at a higher cost.
- **Maintenance and Additional Features:** Long-term maintenance costs and additional features like monitoring systems also contribute to the overall expense of a solar power system.
- **Electrical Upgrades:** Sometimes, existing electrical systems may need upgrades to accommodate the new solar system, adding to the installation cost.

## How to Save Money on Your Solar PV Installations

Investing in a solar installation can be financially significant, but there are several strategies to make it more affordable and maximize your investment. Here are some tips to save money on your solar panel installations:

- **Research Government Incentives and Rebates:** The South African National Treasury has outlined guidelines to access the ZAR4 billion rebate program for residential solar PV systems, launched in February. Homeowners can claim a rebate equal to 25% of their solar panel costs, up to ZAR16500. For the 2023/24 filing season, PAYE taxpayers can claim this rebate, while provisional taxpayers can offset it against their provisional and final payments. To be eligible, homeowners must provide a VAT invoice that separately details the cost of the solar PV panels and proof of payment. For systems purchased between March 1, 2023, and February 29, 2026, a compliance certificate with the 2009 Electrical Installation Regulations is required. The rebate is applicable to solar panels in both new and existing systems, with a minimum output of 275 W, but excludes portable panels.
- **Choose the Right System Size:** Opt for a solar system size that matches your energy needs. Over-sizing can lead to unnecessary expenses, while under-sizing may not provide the desired energy savings.
- **Compare Quotes from Multiple Providers:** Get quotations from several solar installers. Comparing prices and services can help you find the best deal and avoid overpaying.
- **Consider Panel Type and Efficiency:** While higher-efficiency panels are more expensive, they can produce more energy in less space. Assess if the long-term savings justify the initial cost.
- **Look for Financing Options:** Explore financing options like solar loans or leases, which can spread the cost over time, making the initial investment more manageable.
- **Invest in Quality Equipment:** Choosing high-quality solar panels and components can be cost-effective in the long run due to their durability and efficiency.
- **DIY Some Aspects of the Installation:** If you have the necessary skills, you can save on labor costs by doing some installation work yourself. However, professional assistance is crucial for electrical connections and complex installations.
- **Plan for Long-Term Performance:** Ensure regular maintenance to keep your solar system running efficiently. This can prevent costly repairs and maintain optimal energy production.
- **Utilize Energy Efficiently:** Adopt energy-efficient practices in your home or business to reduce overall energy consumption. This means a smaller solar system can meet your energy needs, lowering costs.
- **Monitor Energy Usage:** Use monitoring systems to track energy production and consumption. This data can help you adjust usage patterns to maximize solar benefits.

By carefully planning and researching, you can find ways to reduce the cost of your solar installation while enjoying the benefits of renewable energy. Talk to a [Solar Installer Near You](https://www.localpros.co.za/solar-installers/) they can help you make the right choice.

# How much does a home solar system cost?

Thinking of going solar? The upfront cost can be scary, but the benefits are clear.

Finding the right home solar solution can be a time-consuming and confusing exercise. Considering[the cost involved,](https://personal.nedbank.co.za/learn/blog/affordable-solar-steps-to-get-off-the-grid.html ""See how to get off the grid in affordable steps"")this is not something you want to get wrong. If the system’s too small, it won’t power your home when needed, and if it’s too big you’re spending too much to produce more electricity than you can use.

We’ve compared [the general costs](https://personal.nedbank.co.za/learn/blog/hidden-costs-of-going-solar.html ""Don't overlook the hidden costs of going solar"")of 3 different options you can use to generate your own power at home and reduce your reliance on the national grid – or end it completely.

For the purpose of this exercise, we’re going to compare the cost of 5kW solar photovoltaic systems used as a grid-tied, hybrid or fully off-grid installation. A system of this size should be enough for a household that pays around R1,400 for electricity every month, using roughly 960kWh.

If you have a smaller home and [use less electricity,](https://personal.nedbank.co.za/learn/blog/going-off-grid-lifestyle-changes.html ""Learn how some changes can help you use less electricity"")your costs would be a little lower. If you have a larger home, you’re going to need a bigger budget.

The prices used in these examples have been taken from a reputable supplier that offers home solar kits, including all the components, brackets and connectors you’ll need to install a solar system. Costs exclude installation, electrical certificate of compliance and any other service charges.

## **The cost of a grid-tied solar system**

A grid-tied system is one that produces energy whenever you have enough sunlight, but also draws power from the grid when your system isn’t generating enough electricity. This is the cheapest option because it excludes the most expensive component in any solar power system – the batteries. For this installation, 6 solar panels and an inverter (to convert the direct current from the panels into the alternating current used in your home) should be enough to produce the power you need during the day.

In our example, this solution should cost you between R55,000 and R60,000, but you will be using less grid electricity during the day, so the cost will be offset to an extent by savings on your electricity bill.

## **The cost of hybrid solar system**

The advantage of a hybrid system is that it can generate and store electricity most of the time and draw power from the electricity grid only when needed. A hybrid system adds battery storage between the solar panels and your inverter.

#### Generating twice as much power as you consume is a wide safety margin for your off-grid system

But as mentioned, the price increases sharply when you add batteries to the system. For a hybrid system as described, you might want to install 2 batteries to have enough power stored when long periods of cloudy weather cause your system to produce less electricity than usual.

Our chosen hybrid solution with 8 solar panels and 2 batteries will cost you between R115,000 and R120,000.

## **The cost of an off-grid solar system**

Being free of the electricity grid and constant power outages comes at a cost. Yes, you have your own power source, but you’re also totally reliant on it working as it should. If it doesn’t, you'll be left without any electricity and no easy access to an alternative.

That’s why a totally off-grid system needs more solar panels to feed the much bigger bank of batteries to ensure you have enough electricity to run everything in your home and enough stored to keep everything running until the batteries can be recharged by solar power alone.

For this scenario, we considered using as many as 5 batteries, giving you storage capacity of about 18kWh, and needing 8 solar panels to recharge your batteries fully every day. This is not a very big margin of safety, so we also looked at a 9-battery solution that needs 14 solar panels but can store up to 33kWh, double your daily average.

Generating twice as much power as you consume is a wide safety margin for your off-grid system, but it comes at a cost – close to R250,000, to be exact.

## **Counting the cost of going off the grid**

At first glance, these numbers might seem [a little scary.](https://personal.nedbank.co.za/learn/blog/insure-your-home-solar-energy-system.html ""Learn how to insure your solar-power system"") It’s a big investment and a big decision to choose a system and how you’re going to finance it. But if you break down the numbers, you could well justify such a big outlay of money.

We offer Nedbank clients [specialised home solar financing options](https://personal.nedbank.co.za/borrow/solar-finance.html ""See your solar finance options with Nedbank"") from approved service providers as a cost-effective way to reap the benefits of a home solar system.

- **Higher silver and polysilicon prices are pushing up costs for cells and modules with distributed generation projects seeing price increases first.**
- **Wafer and cell prices in China are stabilising at higher levels while transaction volumes remain subdued.**
- **Solar panel (module) makers are lifting quotes for 2026 deliveries in both China and international markets amid cautious demand outlook.**

Rising silver prices are adding fresh cost pressure across the global solar photovoltaic supply chain, reinforcing expectations of higher prices for cells and modules, according to the latest analysis from **[InfoLink Consulting.](https://www.infolink-group.com/)**

Price increase signals have become more pronounced in recent weeks, with transactions in the distributed generation segment moving up ahead of large scale utility projects. The rapid rise in silver prices has significantly increased production costs at cell level, making it more difficult for manufacturers to absorb upstream increases.

**Polysilicon prices trend upward**

Polysilicon prices in China continue to edge higher, with new orders transacted mainly through limited strategic or contractual arrangements. Recent deals have been concluded at around RMB 60 to 65 per kilogram, while overall new quotations are expected to settle at RMB 63 to 65 per kilogram, led by tier one suppliers.

Most trading volumes remain linked to earlier contracts, although transaction prices are showing a clear upward bias. Outside China, polysilicon prices remain firm, with spot prices in the United States rising as buyers hedge against potential policy risks. Market sentiment remains cautious due to rising inventories and seasonally weak demand, with production discipline in the first quarter expected to play a key role in stabilising prices.

**Wafer and cell markets show price resilience**

Wafer prices in China remained largely stable week on week, although actual transaction levels suggest a gradual upward movement. Improved acceptance of current wafer prices by cell manufacturers is helping to support the market, particularly for the 183N format, which is gaining production share.

Cell prices in China increased again this week, with average prices across mainstream N type formats reaching RMB 0.39 per watt. Leading manufacturers have begun quoting above RMB 0.40 per watt following the surge in silver prices, while some have suspended deliveries due to mounting cost pressures. As a result, transaction volumes have declined sharply and production cuts are expected to extend into February.

In export markets, both P type and N type cell prices have also moved higher, especially for products using non China polysilicon and shipped from Southeast Asia to the United States.

**Module prices rise amid cautious demand**

Module manufacturers in China have started to raise quotes in response to higher upstream costs and industry self regulation measures. Distributed generation projects are again leading price increases, while utility scale projects are adjusting more gradually.

Average TOPCon module prices in China have risen to around RMB 0.70 per watt, supported by a higher share of distributed projects. HJT module prices have also been revised upward, with higher power ratings commanding a premium.

In non China markets, module prices remain broadly stable for near term deliveries, but suppliers are increasing quotes for 2026 orders. Europe has seen modest upward adjustments linked to silver costs, while prices in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America remain competitive. In the United States, pricing continues to diverge widely depending on supply routes and compliance requirements.

Looking ahead, InfoLink Consulting notes that demand is likely to remain soft in the first quarter of 2026 due to seasonal factors and higher prices. While cost pressures are expected to persist, cautious procurement sentiment and limited order visibility suggest that further price increases may face resistance in the near term.
